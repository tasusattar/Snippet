Unfolded the truth on how to read on devices. The real way to read.

Paperbacks are meant to be cluttered and full. Supposed to drown in the glory of ink on the lands of paper.
Our devices are different. We prefer to have our screens be minimally intrusive and deliver our us ioration
in small portions.

Read your ebooks in 'snips': break up the material to be read and have the message be presented/conveyed
in small snippets rather than the full thing at once.
