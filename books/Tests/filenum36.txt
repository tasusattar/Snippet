<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_44">Chapter 31</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
She lay on her back. She couldn’t move. Efforts to flex
her legs caused her right thigh to cramp. A tight strap pressed around her ribs
just beneath her breasts, barely allowing her to breathe. A band like bony
fingers encircled her right wrist and presumably her left, as well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani opened her right eye and felt the depressingly familiar
release of tension as her film split. She blinked. A slimy hydropolymer
fragment slid off her eyeball and down her cheek, leaving a cold, damp snail
track in its wake.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Well, let’s see how much more damage we can do</i>. She
opened both eyes wide. Her left film remained intact, but her right continued
to fissure. Her vision alternately blurred and sharpened as bits and pieces
floated across her eye, then over the side, leaving her right cheek cool and
sticky.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
After a few determined blinks, Jani’s vision cleared enough
that she could look around. Up to a point. <i class="calibre4">Nice ceiling</i>. Dull white,
from what she could tell, since the room’s lighting left something to be
desired. She lifted her head as high as she could. Darker walls, somewhere in
the cheery blue family. In the far corner, near the door, two frame chairs
squatted near a low, dispo-littered table. Someone had eaten their meal out of
a box. More than one someone, judging from the number of containers.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">They ate and watched me sleep</i>? Jani tried to swallow
and coughed as her dry throat prickled. Her mouth felt lined with absorbent,
her lips, dry and rough. She summoned up what saliva she could and ran her
tongue over her teeth. She pulled against her restraints again; her lower back
tightened. She sagged back on the bed and tried to gather her scattering
thoughts.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Not just any room. I’m in a hospital</i>. Jani could tell
from the smells in the air. Chemical. Antiseptic. Freshly cleaned bed linens
and an underlying hint of metal. Especially metal. Instruments. Cold, sharp,
and always too large.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">This is for your own good, Captain</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shivered at the memory of her examinations, embedded in
flesh and bone and brought to life by her surroundings. John had gotten to the
point where he flinched each time she did, which only made things worse. Val
Parini, meanwhile, always examined her with the distracted air of one who had
seen the worst, and rest assured, Jani, you aren’t even close.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But that bastard DeVries had enjoyed hurting her. At first,
she thought herself the unlucky recipient of his warped version of foreplay.
But as time went on, she was compelled to conclude the man simply did not like
her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Hell, he hated my guts. He felt I distracted John from
their greater purpose</i>. She had heard the arguments. Raised voices in the
hall outside her room.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Open your little rat eyes, John! The A-G wants her, so hand
her over. Hang on to her, she’ll drag us and everything we’ve worked for right
into the sewer with her. We’ve learned what we needed from her—give her up!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stroked the bedsheet. Warm, where her hand had rested.
Smooth. Pure white. Like John. He never lost his temper during DeVries’s
tirades. He’d slip into her room afterward, pull a chair beside her bed, and
watch her as she pretended to sleep. Always the same position, legs crossed at
the knees, hands folded in his lap. The attitude of a man who owned the store
and the street besides.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Hello, creation—my name is John Shroud</i>, he’d said to
her the first time she’d opened her eyes to find him there. <i class="calibre4">Unfortunate name
for a physician, don’t you think</i>? His milk white skin had seemed to glow in
the harsh light, his voice rumbling from a source nowhere near his heart.
Palest blue eyes had glittered like cut crystal. In the stupor following the
reversal of her induced coma, Jani had thought him some sort of implacable,
medically trained angel.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">It was the color of his eyes that did it—turned out they
were fake</i>. John’s eyes were pink, in reality. He’d been the one who taught
her how to film. And how to walk, dress, and feed herself with the aid of numb,
twitchy animandroid limbs. <i class="calibre4">Being a freak has its drawbacks</i>, he’d told
her. <i class="calibre4">But it has its advantages, as well. Trust me, I know what I’m talking
about</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But he’d never shown her how to burst a restraint. <i class="calibre4">Bad John.</i> Jani pulled against the straps
until the pain brought tears to her eyes. Then she raised her head and looked
at herself. <i class="calibre4">I was wearing clothes, wasn’t I</i>? If she had, they’d since
been replaced by a plain-fronted white gown. In the crook of her right arm, a
raised silver disc glittered in the dim light.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh hell</i>—!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Too late. Cued by her increased movement and elevated blood
pressure, the sedative pump activated. Jani felt the skin beneath the disc
tingle. A heartbeat later, warmth rippled up her arm and across her chest. <i class="calibre4">I
don’t want to sleep anymore, damn it</i>! She yanked again at her restraints,
but the straps held fast.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Sweat bloomed on her forehead, under her arms. Chills. Her
stomach spasmed. Burning rose in her throat. <i class="calibre4">I’m going to vomit</i>! She
tried to turn on her side, but the chest strap held her down. <i class="calibre4">I’ll drown in
it</i>! She forced herself still, breathed in slowly and deeply, willed the
nausea to pass. Acid harshness percolated to the base of her tongue and stayed
there. <i class="calibre4">For now</i>. If she continued moving, the pump would administer
another dose after a buffer period had passed. Could be thirty minutes, or
thirty seconds, depending on the drug.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked toward the door. Funny no one had checked on
her. The sensors in the bed had to be monitoring her vitals. Didn’t anyone
notice the increased activity?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She worked her hands. The skin on her right wrist burned as
she moved. <i class="calibre4">I’m hurting myself—these shouldn’t hurt</i>. What kind of
restraints were these? <i class="calibre4">Old</i>. And poorly applied. <i class="calibre4">I’m not in a place
where they’re used to strapping people down</i>. That seemed promising. Maybe
they wouldn’t know how to handle her if she broke loose.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She pulled against her left wrist restraint. Gently and
firmly at first, then not so gently and much more firmly. All she felt was the
compression. When her hand became stuck, she tugged harder still. A few muffled
cracks sounded. It worked through the narrow opening more easily after that.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani held up the hand for inspection. The little finger
twitched uselessly, corkscrew-twisted wrong side up. The thumb’s movement was
barely perceptible. The whole hand had numbed—she couldn’t even detect pressure
anymore. She loosened the strap beneath her breasts. <i class="calibre4">Thumbs come in handy
when you’re trying to work buckles</i>, she thought as she tried to unlatch the
strap she couldn’t see using fingers she couldn’t feel.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How’s it goin’ there, Captain?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani glanced to the side. Borgie sat perched on her end
table, cradling his T-40 like a bouquet of long-stemmed roses. “You could
help,” she replied.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Smoke puffed from the man’s flak jacket as he shrugged.
“Can’t, ma’am. You know that.” The fact seemed to desolate him—his hangdog
expression appeared even more gloomy than usual. “Yolan’s here, too,” he said,
momentarily brightening. “She’s found a new friend.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The chest strap fell away. Jani sat up and freed her right
wrist and ankles. “Are they out in the hall, Sergeant? Does that mean you know
where we are?” She looked again at Borgie, whose smile faded.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Can’t help you, ma’am,” he repeated. “You know that.” As
Jani struggled out of bed, he stood up and shouldered the T-40. An odd odor
wafted about him as he moved. Not scorched gloves, this time, but something
familiar that Jani couldn’t quite place. Scorched, yes, but not gloves . . ..
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, great!” She felt for the back of the knee-length gown
and caught a handful of bare ass. “I had clothes, didn’t I? Where the hell are
they!” She caught Borgie’s eye just as he was about to shrug another negative.
His shoulders sagged.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—<i class="calibre4">bullshit</i>—!” The sound pierced through the closed
door. Jani backpedaled toward the bed, prepared to dive under the sheet if
anyone entered, but no one came. Instead, the voices grew louder.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—see you in hell before I call him in! Once you call in a
facility chief, forget it!” A man’s voice. Enraged. “—empty bedpans for the
rest of my life—!” Jani tasted the panic, as well. Like bile. The taste
reminded her of the pump. She worked her index finger beneath the thin disc—it
left a raised, bloody welt in the crook of her arm. The itch had taken on a
squirmy life of its own, as though worms crawled through her elbow and up her
arm.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You have no choice, <i class="calibre4">Doctor</i>!” Another man’s voice. No
panic, but you could fuel transports with the anger. “Look at the liver
enzymes! When did you ever see values like those!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The doctor countered, voice lower, shaky. “Are you sure you
calibrated the blood analyzer properly?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Silence. Which spoke volumes. “I ran the drug screen,” the
angry man finally replied. “She’d been dosed with Ascertane sometime in the
past seventy-two hours. Her blood contains metabolite NCH-12. The last bulletin
we got stated that if any patient turned up positive for that metabolite, we
were to notify the nearest facility chief immediately. Now, Doctor, are you
going to call Cal Montoya, or am I?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The doctor spoke, his voice softer, words impossible to
discern. Jani left Borgie standing by the door and walked back to her bed. Near
the headboard, a wheeled IV rack stood like a skeletal sentry. She hefted it,
checked it for balance, swung it back and forth like a baseball bat.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Heavy, Captain?” Borgie had started poking through the
dispos on the low table, wrinkling his nose at what he found.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Nope. Under control, Sergeant.” Holding the rack in her
right hand, Jani headed for the door. It swept open for her, revealing a larger
room, an examination table, lab furniture, and assorted analyzers. The doctor
and his angry colleague leaned over a desk, their backs to her, still arguing.
The desktop was cluttered with readout cards, sheets of notes, and stacks of
textbooks.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The angry man turned. Jani recognized him. Vaguely. <i class="calibre4">The
duty nurse</i>? His eyes widened. He reached out to her just as she swung the
rack around.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Both men wore medwhites. Jani stripped off the doctor’s.
Fewer bloodstains. She put them on, then scrounged through the glass-fronted
cabinets, uncovering bottles of film former, a white medcoat, scuffed white
work shoes. She washed away blood, dressed, refilmed her eyes. Light brown
filming. Poor coverage. The green showed through—her eyes appeared
phosphorescent in the office lighting.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You look like a crazy wonko, Captain,” Borgie said dryly as
they left the infirmary. “Get the urge to drop ’em and bend over just looking
at ya.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Control yourself, Sergeant.” Jani tried to smile, but one
look at Borgie’s face stopped her. It had changed in the past few minutes.
Blackened in places. Blistered in others. One ear was gone. The peculiar odor
that followed the man like a faithful hound had grown stronger. “Am I dying,
Borgie?” she asked. “Or am I just cracking up?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her sergeant, her dead sergeant, stared at her through
cloudy eyes. Cloudier eyes. His dark brown irises grew milkier as he spoke.
“Captain, I can’t help you. It’s all you.” His voice rasped with desperation. “<i class="calibre4">Your</i>
questions! <i class="calibre4">Your</i> answers!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
They paused so Jani could get a drink of water from the hall
cooler. After the fifth dispoful, Borgie began to fidget, so Jani reluctantly
tossed the cup in the ’zap and fell in behind him. The people they passed in
the halls looked at Jani’s clothing, never at her. No one challenged them, or
tried to stop them. <i class="calibre4">I mean, me. No one’s tried to stop me</i>. Her sergeant
had nothing to worry about. He possessed his own unique brand of camou.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Good ol’ Borgie</i>, Jani thought as she watched the
man’s smoking back. “<i class="calibre4">Sais-tu ou nous allons</i>, Sergent Burgoyne?” she
asked him. <i class="calibre4">Do you know where we are going</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Mais oui, ma Capitaine</i>.” Borgie looked back at her
as he spoke. His other ear, along with most of his cheek, had burned away.
White and yellow blisters glistened in the light.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The acid rose once more in Jani’s throat. She recognized the
smell now.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Borgie led her through an anteroom and into an office.
Expensive paintings. View of a lake. Nighttime. Moon reflecting on rippling
water. Jani expected to see a man sitting at the desk, but instead, she saw a
woman. A friend. Dead, of course, like Borgie. Funny how that fact seemed to
concern her less and less.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yolan.” Jani approached the desk slowly. Her old corporal
still wore her usual startled-deer expression. Her lazored blonde hair was as
neatly combed as ever. Her steel blues appeared battered, though. But it was
brick dust, not smoke, which puffed from the material as Yolan nodded weakly.
The rubble had buried her fairly deep, after all. Oddly enough, her gamine face
had remained untouched, but her body . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Bones in a bag</i>. All that had been left. Borgie had
waited for Jani to turn her back before he fell to his knees and gathered that
limp body in his arms. Yes, his relationship with Yolan had crossed every line.
Yes, Jani had known, and kept it to herself. The one time she got involved was
when Borgie asked her to persuade Neumann not to leave Yolan behind at Rauta
Shèràa Base. Neumann hadn’t wanted to take her to Knevçet Shèràa. He trusted
her even less than he had Jani. “I killed her, Captain,” Borgie had cried. His
weeping had seemed to sound from the walls themselves, following Jani as she
left that section of the bombed wing, dogging her down every hall, echoing around
every corner.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I helped, Sergeant</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We had to come here,” Yolan explained to Borgie, who loomed
over her in his still-futile effort to appear domineering. “She got scared out
in the open. Didn’t want to risk seeing him again until she knew she could take
it.” Her delicate features set in stern lines, Yolan turned to Jani. “Captain
or not, you say anything mean to her and I swear, I’ll air you out. She’s been
through enough.” The corporal leaned her head back. The chair rocked back as
well. It dawned on Jani that Yolan had yet to move from the neck down.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fine, fine,” Jani nodded. “Bossy-assed mainliner.” A flash
of movement captured her attention. She turned. “<i class="calibre4">You</i>!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha Concannon stood in the middle of the office, her
clothing rumpled, her hair tangled. She tried to speak, then winced and held a
hand to her throat. Jani saw the steel blue scarf knotted around her neck and
looked at Yolan, who regarded her levelly. “She wanted something to cover the
bruises. She’s sensitive about them.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, bully for her,” Jani replied. “She left her best
friend to be accused of her murder. She betrayed everyone she worked with and
for. She’s a liar and a cheat and an accomplice in Lyssa van Reuter’s murder!
And she’s one of ours, damn it! She should have known better!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Being colony’s no guarantee of goodness, Captain.” Yolan
spoke slowly, as though reprimanding a child. “You’ve lived out there long
enough to know that. Besides, you knew what Betha was about, deep down. That’s
why you worried about her. But you cut her slack because she was colony.
Because she was a dexxie. Maybe if you’d trusted her less, she’d still be
alive.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not fair, Yolan,” Borgie protested. His words came muffled
and slurred, spoken as they were through lips now swollen and blistered. “Don’t
put that on her, too.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But she wants it that way.” Yolan’s eyes never left Jani’s
face. “She wants to be nailed to the cross. She’ll even pass out hammers and
spikes to all comers, with instructions where to pound.” The corporal’s head
lolled against the back of her chair. Borgie propped it upright with a gentle
hand. “Doesn’t help, does it, Cap? Won’t help till the day you die, and after
that, it won’t matter.” She looked at Betha. “No one deserves to die like she
did. Do something about <i class="calibre4">that</i>. Take care of what you can.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked out the window, to the floor, the walls,
everywhere but at the three people who stared at her silently. The three dead
people. <i class="calibre4">How far gone are you, when the ghosts are more human than you</i>?
Her right arm itched to the point of pain. Pinkish yellow seepage stained the
medcoat sleeve. Her right shoulder felt hot. Breathing had become difficult, as
though she wore a clogged respirator. She forced herself to look at Betha. “It
was Ridgeway.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha nodded slowly, using her hand to stop the movement.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’d been working for him. All along.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Another labored nod.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ridgeway helped you bugger the docs Lyssa took to Nueva. He
had an accomplice at the hospital, a doctor who purposely botched Lyssa’s
regularly scheduled take-down. Lyssa made it to Chira before hallucinating
herself into the rocks, and Ridgeway thought the one person who knew Evan had
transmitted the order to bomb my transport was dead.” Jani paused to look at
Borgie. What did she expect to find on his charring face, an expression of
surprise?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But you had friends at the PM’s,” she continued. “They told
you what Cao and Ulanova suspected. You made friends with Lyssa before she left
on that final trip, and she entrusted the proof she had compiled to you. At
first, you planned to turn it all over to Ridgeway, in exchange for whatever.
Then you got greedy. It never occurred to you he could kill you, too.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha’s mouth moved in mute pleading. She managed a sharp
squeak when sounds of activity reached them from the anteroom.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani slipped behind the shelter of a shoulder-high plant.
Betha, Borgie, and Yolan remained where they were. Durian Ridgeway burst in,
walking through his cowering victim on the way to the desk. He began a frenzied
search, opening and slamming drawers until, with a bark of relief, he pulled a
grey documents pouch from the bottom drawer and tossed it on his desktop. With
Borgie and Yolan as fascinated bookends, he dumped out the contents and flipped
through the pages, muttering under his breath.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stepped out from behind the plant, ignoring Borgie’s
frantic gesturing for her to stay put. “It’s not in there, Granny.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway tensed. He looked up slowly. “Risa.” His hands
dropped below the level of the desktop. “I thought you were in the infirmary.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I was.” She took a step toward the desk in an attempt to
circle around to Ridgeway’s side, but he quickly countered, edging away in the
opposite direction. “The Consulate comlog. The one that shows the call Evan
made to the fuel depot. It’s not there.” Jani sidled closer to the desk, but
stopped as Ridgeway backed away in the direction of the door. “It’s in the
hands of whoever Ginny Doyle is really working for. Judging from your behavior,
that person isn’t you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Captain Kilian. Jani. The call recorded on that log does
not constitute proof. Our personnel at the depot were in constant communication
with Consulate staff. Quite necessary, considering the circumstances. Surely
you remember?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The way you’re acting bitches that argument to hell,
Durian. You raised the alarm that Betha was missing. Then you steered Doyle
after Steve. When Steve disappeared, you shifted everyone’s sights toward me.
Anything to deflect attention from Evan. He told me you’d do what you think you
had to. You’re not stupid. If everything’s green, why bother with it? Why clean
it if it ain’t dirty?” Jani watched Ridgeway’s hands, still below desktop
level.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">He has a shooter</i>. She glanced at Borgie, who now
stood by a sofa on the other side of the room. Betha stood beside him, one hand
at her throat, the other over her mouth. Yolan sat on the sofa, her legs
propped on the low table in front of her, her arms limp, hands in her lap.
“He’s armed, Cap,” she said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know,” Jani replied.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway stiffened. “Still talking to yourself, Jani? Who
answers? Riky Neumann?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Never. Why waste a good hallucination?” The burning itch in
her arm had receded to a dull scratchiness. “I see Betha. She’s over there, by
the sofa.” She raised her arm to point and Ridgeway flinched to one side as
though anticipating a blow. He brought the shooter up and pointed it at her
chest. Direct line of fire. One shot. Crack the sternum. Stop the heart. Not
even augie could fight this one off.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
This time, it would take.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Here’s the hammer</i>. Jani took another step toward him.
<i class="calibre4">The spikes</i>. Another. <i class="calibre4">What are you waiting for</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha’s mouth opened in a soundless scream.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The shooter rasped. Jani stumbled to her left as the impact
half spun her around. A fleeting pain, in her left shoulder, just above the
joint. Then numbness. Her lungs cleared, her breathing eased. She looked down.
Her arm jerked uselessly. What remained of it. The exit wound had obliterated
the hand. Half the forearm. Rose pink carrier dripped through gaps in the
heat-sealed stump, splattering over the synthetic flesh that now soiled the
carpet. She looked at Ridgeway, who stared back in stunned silence. “You
missed, you goddamn office boy. Point-blank range, and you fucking <i class="calibre4">missed</i>.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
His eyes narrowed. “Is that your challenge, Jani?” She could
smell the hate as he raised the shooter again.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">So slow. He moves. So slow</i>. Jani feinted to her
right, then darted close. Right hand raised, fingers straight. Her sudden
movement distracted Ridgeway. He discharged the shooter off target—the pulse
packet brushed her left cheek as she thrust at his neck just above the base of
the throat. He collapsed to his knees, eyes goggled, grabbing at his throat as
his breath wheezed and whistled like air being sucked through a cracked pipe.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How does it feel, you son of a bitch?” she asked softly as
she stepped behind him. The time for ritual had passed. The curve where his
neck joined his shoulder whispered, <i class="calibre4">here</i>. This time, she listened. Felt
augie’s strength reinforce her own. Raised her right hand. Brought it down.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Cap’n?” Borgie drew alongside her. They watched Ridgeway’s
body until it stopped twitching. Then Jani turned to her sergeant. His face was
a crusted mass now. Eyes glazed white. He crackled when he moved. “Wuh be’er
go.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani edged out into the hall and looked at herself in one of
the safety-dome mirrors set in the ceiling. She had folded the empty documents
pouch over her ruined forearm. The shooter graze had left a reddened brush burn
on her cheek. <i class="calibre4">I look like a lab accident</i>. She smiled grimly. <i class="calibre4">I am a
lab accident</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“See anything, Cap?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani checked the mirror, saw nothing behind her. Then she
turned. Yolan smiled up at her, broken body bundled into a wheeled office
chair. Betha pushed. Borgie brought up the rear, T-40 raised and ready. Tiny
gouts of flame licked from beneath his flak jacket. His face was . . .
unrecognizable.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani remembered where she was now. <i class="calibre4">Interior Doc Control</i>.
She led the way, past the offices, toward the elevators. At every junction,
she’d look up at a dome mirror and chart her solitary progress. <i class="calibre4">When I look
up and don’t see myself, I’ll know I’m dead</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Empty elevators. Deserted hallways. No one to challenge her,
to stop her. <i class="calibre4">Like they’re giving me room to maneuver</i>. Jani and her
silent trio bypassed empty offices, entered a large anteroom, stopped before a
door. <i class="calibre4">Like they want me to come here</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Once you go through that door, you’re on your own, Cap,”
Yolan said. She’d become spokesman for the trio, seeing as she was the only one
who could talk. “We can’t help you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Decision time, Cap.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know.” Jani gripped the door handle and twisted. Sand
shifted beneath her feet. Desert wind brushed her face and riffled her hair.
</p>
