<h1 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_7">EPILOGUE</h1>


<p class="NormalFirst">
The stylus moved across the blank parchment. Beneath the
moving tip of the writing instrument, the curves and whorls of High Vynshàrau
appeared as though demon-written.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">It is only science</i>, Tsecha thought as he read his
words, reconsidered, and made changes. Pro-dye impregnation. Ultraviolet light.
Delocalization of electrons. So dull, such lucid explanation. He preferred to
believe the words appeared on the paper’s surface by magic, the work of demons.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
His Temple and his Oligarch, if they could have read what he
wrote, would no doubt have agreed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
. . . <i class="calibre4">for humanish ways are not so
different from ours. A piece of clothing. A color of eye. An intonation. Such
are all that separate us</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He frowned, stylus poised above the newly inscribed phrases.
So obvious, the ideas. Did he really need to explain such?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Steven is beyond this.” He sat back in his favored chair,
allowed it to stab him in the usual places, and meditated on the stark
simplicity of his room. Yes, his Mr. Forell had come along quite quickly. But
then, so eager had he been to learn. He had petitioned Tsecha personally for
instruction in Vynshàrau document systems, saying he could not hope to further
his Interior career without such specialized knowledge. Of course, Tsecha had
not believed him. Not when he pulled Angevin into the meeting room after him
like a reluctant youngish, and demanded Tsecha tell him the story of his
Captain.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Yes, Steven had proved most seemly. So open to new thoughts.
Almost as though Hansen had fathered <i class="calibre4">him</i>, and not Angevin….
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I will not ask.” Tsecha contemplated a carved bloom that
rested in a wall niche opposite his desk. Humanish were sensitive to questions
of parentage, and he did not wish to test his Steven’s loyalty so soon. Not to
mention his Angevin’s temper. Best some things be left between the lines, for
now.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">This I know as fact, from experience. As always, I only
write that which is already known, simply unacknowledged</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Instruction, at times, proved challenging. “Steven accepts
as Hansen did, while Angevin fights . . .” Tsecha bared his
teeth. “She fights as my Captain does.” His Captain, who could read his
writings as well as her born tongue, and who understood their meanings all too
well. Where was she now? Lucien offered his guesses, of course. Such was his
way, to never admit to not knowing. But he had misplaced her at the
shuttleport, and his weeks of futile searching had left him morose and prone to
sarcasm.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My Captain is quite skilled at being misplaced, and truly.”
First by John Shroud, then by Anais Ulanova, and now by the odd lieutenant. How
wondrous to be so unknown to so many. To be able to evade so well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">She can never be captured. She will live on, and lead on,
into a time so different than this. This, too, is known but unacknowledged, for
fear of the future prevents its recognition. This, of all manners, is the one
of humanish adopted by idomeni. This is foolish, as I have written before. As I
will write again. Until it, as my dead Hansen used to say, “sinks in.”</i>
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha continued to trace stylus over parchment. In another
room, much as this one, he had written such essays for two other humanish,
instructing them how the universe would change. <i class="calibre4">So it began then</i>. So
would it continue now. Until all would be revealed. One page at a time.
