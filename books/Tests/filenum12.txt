<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani found Evan waiting for her in the Interior executive
wing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Get settled all right?” He ushered her down the
painting-trimmed hallway and into his office. “How’s your room?” He had changed
into civvies. His blue pullover matched his eyes. Unfortunately, the color also
accented the hollows beneath. “Hope you’ve found everything to your liking.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani watched him close in on the bar. She refused his offer
of a drink, noticing glumly that he still opted for straight bourbon. “Why
didn’t you tell me about Nema?” she asked, following with a quick rundown of
her near miss. “I was an eyelash away from being pushed into that room. The physical
changes wouldn’t have thrown him at all—he would have known me instantly.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan dragged another chair over to the visitor’s side of his
desk. He sighed and motioned for Jani to sit.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It caught me by surprise, too.” He lowered his lean frame
into his chair as though he feared the cushions had teeth. “Langley doesn’t
bother to inform me of his visits anymore. I must allow him access to that
portion of the Main House whenever he requires it. He seems to require it
whenever it causes the most inconvenience.” He scowled and sipped his drink.
“What a coincidence.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You could have told me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I tried! I called your suite. You didn’t answer. Knowing
the kind of day you’d had, I assumed you were taking a nap. You always slept
like a rock.” He offered a faint, knowing smile. “I’d been in meetings all
afternoon—I had no idea you’d come back here. How did you get into the secured
section anyway? I hadn’t arranged for your clearance yet.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The elevator let me ride, but it wouldn’t let me steer.”
Jani pressed her fingers to her temples. Her scalp felt two sizes too small.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Somebody must have overridden the security controls in
order to get people up from the subs more quickly. At least we’ll know to be on
our guard for next time. Langley usually times these little invasions every six
to ten days. My staff didn’t expect him until early next week. I guess it was
just Cao’s way of saying, ‘Welcome home.’” Evan rocked his glass back and
forth, clinking nonexistent ice. “Do you need me for anything tonight—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—because I’m busy. Social commitment. A dinner I don’t want
to eat hosted by people I despise. Welcome to the glamorous world of top-level
government.” He set down his drink. “I have what you came here for.” He rose
and walked back to his desk. “Don’t want to waste your time.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re not.” Jani watched Evan’s shoulders work beneath his
sweater. He had never been exactly strapping, but he looked bonier than she
remembered. “Have you eaten anything today?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I had lunch,” he replied vaguely as he opened a drawer and
withdrew a thick, scuffed binder. “I found these in the parts bins, locked away
in a drawer.” He silenced Jani’s protest with a look. “I know as a nondoc, I
shouldn’t be allowed in there. Don’t ask me how I gained access—you don’t want
to know.” He set the files on the table between them.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani hefted the binder into her lap and examined the black
cover. She flipped the cover open. Her palms felt damp. <i class="calibre4">Call me Pandora</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Please don’t read it now.” Evan advanced on the bar again.
“Take it out of here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Evan—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t understand how much it sickens me to know you’re
going to read that. But you have to, don’t you? It’s your job. It’s what I
asked you here to do.” His voice had taken on a formal tone. Very van Reuter.
“So you had better go do it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tucked the binder under her arm and headed for the
door. “Enjoy your dinner.” She paused in the doorway and looked back at him.
“Bicarb lozenges are great for masking liquor breath, by the way.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a
half-empty foil-wrapped cylinder. “I’ve been buying them by the case for
years,” he said, raising his glass to her. Jani closed the door before she had
to watch him drain it.
</p>

</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
Against all logic, her stomach started growling as she
mounted the Private House’s sweeping main stairway and wended through the
second-floor hallways toward her room. Her appetite had increased markedly over
the past few months. <i class="calibre4">Must be the cold weather</i>. She was considering the
possibilities her cooler offered when the faint smell of fresh coffee brought
her to full alert.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
On the table outside her door, she found a tray laden with
what apparently constituted the House’s version of an evening snack. Next to
the swan-necked silver ewer containing the coffee rested a plate of sliced
fresh fruit, a keep-warm basket filled with sweetened bread, and a three-tiered
dish containing colorful miniature cakelets and cookies.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani wrestled through the door with her duffel, the file
binder, and the tray, determined to shovel everything into the room at once even
though she knew it would go much more smoothly if she’d just put something
down. She staggered back-bowed and lopsided to the bed, depositing her burden
just before straps slid and binders freed themselves and whomped onto trays.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She popped an anise cookie into her mouth as reward for a
job well done, then activated the suite’s music system, pressing the pad beside
her bed until she found something appropriately calming. Mussorgska, she
guessed, as strings swelled and faded. Not the current fashion, but comforting.
Judging from Evan’s behavior when he turned over the binder to her, she would
need some comfort soon.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She pulled off her boots, carried the tray into the
kitchenette, and poured and arranged. Soon, she was ensconced in her office,
steaming mug in hand, feet on desk, binder in lap, scanpack within easy reach.
She’d closed the curtains to block out the night, but left her office door wide
open. She wanted to feel cozy, not trapped.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She opened the binder, glanced over the stripped-down table
of contents, then paused to read more carefully as familiar terms caught her
eye. <i class="calibre4">Initial Hopgood Analysis—Page Four. Insertion and Activation—Page Nine</i>.
She set down her coffee and read further. <i class="calibre4">Dobriej Parameters. Physical
Markers. Final Scans—Page Twenty-One</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani thumbed through the hefty binder. “There are a hell of
a lot more than twenty-one pages here!” She browsed psych evals, handwritten
notes, Neoclona emergency calls, and wound up staring at the Commonwealth
Police report of an accident that occurred at the van Reuter summer compound
north of Chicago. A boating accident in which three children died.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A blast of woodwinds jerked Jani upright. She hurried into
the bedroom and killed the music, then fixed herself a drink. Water. With lots
of ice. To quell the burning in her stomach.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She returned to her office. From the recesses of
well-stocked drawers, she removed a pad of paper and several colored pens. On
the first sheet of the pad, Jani roughed out a three-column grid, then wrote,
“Initial Hopgood” and “Insert and Act.” in the first, “Dob,” “PM,” and “Finals”
in the second.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The third column, she left blank.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Four hours later, the third column remained blank. Jani
stared at the empty space, debated going through the binder one more time, then
shook her head. She hadn’t found what she sought because it wasn’t there to
find.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She walked to the window and drew aside the curtain. The
night sky was clear, the glitter of city illumination reflecting sharp
silver-gold off the lake surface. She cracked the weather seal and let frigid
air wash over her. When her face felt the way her left arm always did, she
closed the window and massaged the blood back into her cheeks.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
After a few minutes, she returned to her desk and wrote,
“Augmentation of Martin van Reuter” across the top of the grid. Every report
needed a title, even the ones you couldn’t finish.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
During her postcrash recovery, she had learned more about
her augmentation than she ever wanted to know. The physical reactions it
induced had sped her recovery in some ways and hampered it in others, and John
Shroud had been adamant she learn its idiosyncrasies along with him. <i class="calibre4">I can’t
believe you waited this long</i>, he had said. <i class="calibre4">Willful ignorance will only
harm you in the long run</i>. So she forced herself to read the files he purloined
for her, memorized the terms, the sequences, the whys and wherefores.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The evaluations had begun during her first month in OCS.
She’d been a borderline case. Hopgood analysis confirmed her tendency toward
vivid dreams. One Service physician had expressed grave concern over the
activity seen in certain regions of her thalamus during Dobriej sensory-input
testing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But when the war came, the Service augmented Jani for the
same reason they did all their eligible personnel—as a precaution. The enclave
should have bugged out as soon as the fighting began. <i class="calibre4">But we had a GateWay
station to protect, commercial interests to oversee</i>. Besides, the
opportunity to observe the orderly idomeni at war proved too great a
temptation. <i class="calibre4">To walk ignored past battles like figurines in bell jars. To be
protected by the simple fact it wasn’t our war</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Of course, it couldn’t last. <i class="calibre4">We watched with our faces
pressed against the glass. Before we could stop ourselves, we’d broken through</i>.
Learned names. Become involved.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani escaped to her sitting room. Desperate for voices, she
activated her holoVee, flipping through the channels until she found a
broadcast of a soccer match. The Gold Round of the last Commonwealth Cup. She
watched bright blue Serran and red-and-gold-striped Phillipan jerseys dash up
and down the field as the crowd roiled and roared.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I shouldn’t have been augmented, but at least I was old
enough to adapt</i>. She sat on the couch, watched the colors flicker, listened
to the ebb and flow of noise. She ate a balanced diet. Kept hydrated. Avoided
conflict whenever possible. <i class="calibre4">I haven’t had a precautionary take-down in
almost twenty years</i>. And she’d never need one. <i class="calibre4">I know the difference
between right and wrong—no altered neurochemical cascade is going to push me
over the edge</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Someone like her was supposed to be the worst-case scenario,
the absolute limit to which a dodgy technology could be pushed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
So, whose decision was it to test a prototype personality
augment on a three-year-old boy?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">What did they think they were doing</i>? When they
enhanced what they believed to be Martin’s authoritative tendencies, were they
surprised when he fought with playmates and flew into tantrums when his wishes
were thwarted? Were they astonished when he attacked his father with a lazor at
the age of six, or when he pushed his little brother down stairs at eight.
Repeatedly tried to force himself on his mother, then his sister, beginning at
age eleven?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
When they did everything they could to enhance Martin’s
feeling that he, and only he, was the van Reuter heir, were they shocked that
he planned the murders of his brother and sister?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But the storm got you before your parents could</i>.
Given the justifications for Martin’s behavior she found in the psych evals, it
would have been interesting to see how <i class="calibre4">la famille</i> van Reuter would have
worked out from under that one. And they would have. The pattern had been set.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani pondered Martin’s blank third column. She had
constructed the same sort of chart during her hospital stay, filling her own
third column with the terms for post-augie analysis and counseling. In her
case, they led to the conclusion that a mistake had been made, but that Captain
Kilian, an Academy-trained documents examiner in whom the Service had invested
so much, would just have to be taught how to adjust.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Poor Marty—they just turned you loose on an unsuspecting
world</i>. Then buried the evidence and prevented the unsuspecting world from
figuring out what the hell had happened. <i class="calibre4">Evan didn’t even allow an autopsy</i>.
The miniscule masses, buried next to Martin’s amygdala, would have shown up
during the examination of his brain. They had formed from the components
injected into his ventricular system, produced all those neurotransmitter
analogues whose names Jani had managed to forget. Tried to forget. Would forget,
eventually.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She worked a finger beneath her hair at the place where
skull met spine, and felt the tiny, raised, round scar. The secondary
depositions near her thyroid and adrenal glands had been minor discomforts
compared to the insertion of the primary augmentation. Having her head
immobilized in the stereotaxic restraint had shaken her up, and she’d been a
grown woman. How would that damned skull-cage have affected a toddler?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
And the headache afterward . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She fixed her attention upon the soccer match. Phillipi’s
star right wing had just scored what would prove to be the winning goal. The
screen filled with the raucous tumble of a red-and-gold pile-on.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani switched channels, flicking past serials,
documentaries, and travelogues before coming to rest on a real-time news
transmit. <i class="calibre4">Live—from the palazzo of Treasury Main</i>! She watched the
florid-faced Treasury Minister, the stark Exterior Minister, and several
tightly wrapped colonial governors approach the eager throng of reporters like
hikers nearing the edge of a cliff. The governors kept their replies short,
while Treasury Minister Abascal entoned the antisecession line in which Prime
Minister Cao believed so firmly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But Exterior Minister Ulanova held sway as always. As soon
as she approached the Veephones, the governors fell silent and Abascal’s mouth
contorted in a dyspeptic smile. No, the PM’s views on colonial autonomy did not
alarm Exterior, Ulanova said in her warm alto, nor did Cao’s unwillingness to
entertain opposing views mean all talks on the subject would cease.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Then Ulanova relinquished the spotlight, and Evan sauntered
to the fore, his clear eyes and healthy color a testament to the liberal
ingestion of both black coffee and dehydro boosters. He ignored a question
concerning Lyssa’s death and launched into a point-by-point disassembly of
Ulanova’s views.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, Evan.” Jani listened as he reaffirmed every point he’d
made on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>. He left out his beliefs concerning Ulanova’s
ambitions, of course, but the intimation was there if you knew what to listen
for. “I don’t think that’s what Anais had in mind.” She watched the Exterior
Minister’s visage grow stonier as each verbal missile Evan launched made
target. “You spiked her, Evan. This was your chance to play nice, and you bit
your playmates and kicked sand.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A flash of silver-blond captured Jani’s attention. She
watched Lucien Pascal lean over Exterior Minister Ulanova’s shoulder and
whisper in her ear. The woman nodded sharply; Lucien responded with the smile
Jani knew so well after five weeks on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Roc cui’jaune</i>,” she whispered to the smug face on
the screen. “That means ‘stones of brass,’ you son of a bitch.” Lucien bent
forward again, allowing her a clear view of the red lieutenant’s bars adorning
his Service tunic collar. “A mainline spine.” She squinted to see if she could
pick up the tiny gold letter in the center of the bar.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I spy with my little eye a letter <i class="calibre4">I</i>. Intelligence.
Wonderful.” Jani switched off the holoVee and stared into the blank screen.
“What the hell have I walked into?” She slumped against the soft cushions and
studied the ceiling. Then she went into the kitchenette and applied herself to
the still-warm bread, washing it down with another healthy dose of coffee.
Afterward, she cleaned her dishes, zapped her trash, stored the uneaten food,
and scrubbed until everything shone and even her old drill instructor could not
have found fault.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Then she returned to her office and studied her columns.
After a while, she flipped to a clean page, and wrote, “Lyssa’s death—Martin’s
augie” along the top. When Lucien’s sailracers distracted her, she slammed them
facedown on the desktop. When she grew too exhausted to hold her head up, she
stretched out on her office floor, duffel by her side, and slept.
