<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_34">Chapter 21</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
<i class="calibre4">What do you think,
Eamon?</i>
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Still the ugliest girl in the bar, John</i>. DeVries’s <i class="calibre4">r</i>s
rolled like pebbles down a hillside. Jani felt his breath abrade her newly
grown cheek as he leaned closer. <i class="calibre4">Not enough booze in the Commonwealth to
make me take that home</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">She can hear you, Eamon</i>. John’s voice rumbled, the
warning growl of a watchdog.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I know</i>. Jani could hear the smile in DeVries’s voice.
<i class="calibre4">So what</i>? Brutal chill washed over the fresh skin of her torso as he
yanked down her sheet. <i class="calibre4">I still think we should have given her bigger tits</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
No words after that. Sounds of a scuffle. DeVries’s startled
yelp. The whine of a door mechanism being forced open, then closed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Footsteps.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Don’t listen to him</i>. John pulled up the thermal sheet
and tucked it under her chin. <i class="calibre4">You’re beautiful. Val made sure</i>. Then came
silence. The hum of a skimgurney. Another trip to another lab. Another
immersion tank. More jostling, jostling, jostling . . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“God damn you, Risa!” The mild rocking ramped to a Level Ten
landquake. “Wake up! <i class="calibre4">Now</i>!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani’s head pounded. She forced open one eye. Saw red. Hair.
Glowing in too-bright light. “Where’s John?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Who the hell is John?” Fingers worked into Jani’s hair,
tilted her head up.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">White white ceiling ceiling oh shit</i>—! Her stomach
shuddered. She closed her eye.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh no. Don’t you dare pass out on me.” Skittering footsteps
like fingernails on glass. Running water. “Stay awake this time, damn you!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Cold. Wet. On her face, her neck, her hands. She opened both
eyes this time as she licked away the droplets that had fallen on her lips.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you thirsty?” Angevin’s face lightened. “Good. Thirsty,
I can handle.” She stared at the soggy washcloth as though it had appeared by
magic, then folded it and laid it across Jani’s forehead. “Be right back.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani blinked, testing her films. The cloth slid down her
face and settled in a drippy wad in the middle of her chest. Cold water soaked
through her shirt, darkening the blue to black. She shivered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where the hell is—” Angevin’s voice bounced into the tiled
bathroom from the kitchenette. “Oh, I found it—never mind.” Sounds of running.
“Is this ok?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani turned her head. Carefully.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin stood in the doorway holding a filled glass. “It’s
helgeth. Is that ok? I saw all the dispos in the front of the cooler—figured it
was your favorite.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani nodded. Worked her stiff jaw. “Ye—yes. Thanks.” She
struggled into a sitting position and wrapped her shaky hands around the glass.
The first swallow stripped the film from her mouth and some of the haze from
her brain. “What time is it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Two in the morning. At least it was when I—” Angevin
glanced at her timepiece. “It’s two-twenty now. I found you here on the floor.
You came to a couple times, but you kept drifting out again. You’ve got an
awful knock on your forehead. Scared me. I thought you had a concussion. What
the hell happened to you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Out for almost six hours, eh</i>? Jani forced herself to
sip the juice. What went down in a hurry had a nasty habit of coming up the
same way. “How did you get in here?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Housekeeping let me in.” Angevin squatted on the tiled
floor. She wasn’t dressed for an early-morning call. In her green-velvet
evening suit and pearl jewelry, she looked like an upper-class cricket. “I said
you had some papers Durian needed, but that you weren’t answering your comport.
Everybody knows Durian—they let me in out of sympathy.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You found me unconscious on my bathroom floor and didn’t
call a doctor?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.” Angevin wavered under Jani’s hard stare. “I kept
thinking about Lucien, about what I picked up for you. If anything happened to
you, Durian would have found an excuse to search your suite.” Worry dulled her
eyes to brown. “I didn’t want to get you into trouble.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Thanks.” Jani took a larger swallow of juice. “What’s going
on?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“All our staff meetings have been canceled until further
notice. Durian’s been bumping all his appointments, but no one knows why.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He saw me this afternoon.” Jani hesitated. “Make that
yesterday afternoon.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin sat down on the floor and plucked the washcloth from
its damp resting spot in Jani’s lap. “He’s been making lots of calls to other
Cabinet Houses. No one’s returning them. We were supposed to have a working
dinner with the head of Commerce Doc Control tonight, but they canceled with
about an hour’s notice. Durian ordered me to stay put in my office, but he
won’t tell me anything.” She twisted the cloth, sending more water dripping to
the tile.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani drained her glass, then flexed her neck and shoulders.
She could almost feel the sugar flood her bloodstream. “He met with Colonel
Doyle.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin shook her head. “He saw her, but not for long. Ginny
teaches an advanced judo class three nights a week. A friend of mine takes it.
Ginny was there tonight, same as always.” Her eyes lightened to mossy ice.
“What’s going on?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“This involves Steve, doesn’t it? He’s in it up to his ears,
isn’t he?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani rubbed a smudge on her glass. “I have no way of—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t give me that crap!” Angevin threw the cloth to the floor
and bounded to her feet. Her green demiheels clicked on the glassy floor like
finger cymbals. “He’s been pulling some scam with that bonehead Guernsey buddy
of his. Betha. I tried to warn him about her, but would he listen? Hell, no. I
mean, what am I, anyway? Just a ‘posh little anti-colonial Earthbounder’ who
doesn’t understand what it means to have to work my way up!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s what it sounded like to me,” Jani muttered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin crouched down and grabbed a handful of Jani’s
collar. “Well that just shows you don’t know everything either. So he’s
colony—it bothers him a hell of a lot more than it bothers me!” She released
her, then started patting the rumpled material back into shape. “So,” she said,
her eyes on her task, “how bad is it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani took a steadying breath. “He could go to jail for a
very long time. Betha jazzed paper for Lyssa. Steve helped her cover it up.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fuck. And the general audit’s next week.” Angevin sagged to
the floor. “Why?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Loyalty to another Guernsey kid. The need to show up a system
he hates and wants to join at the same time.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah.” Angevin picked up the discarded cloth and twisted it
into knots. “So how did you find out so much? Did Steve tell you?” She gave the
cloth a particularly strong yank.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani gave a quick rundown of Lyssa’s possible discovery of
Acton van Reuter’s dealings with the Laumrau. “If we can prove Lyssa was killed
because of what she knew, I think we hand the Cabinet Court a much bigger
problem than two low-level dexxies jazzing docs. They won’t get off scot-free,
but since they were involved in bringing a much greater crime to light, they
won’t sit in jail until they’re eighty, either.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And you trust Betha to see this through?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What else can she do? If she goes to any of her superiors
with things as they now stand, she’s screwed. I also tried to impress upon her
the fact that, if she flees, her life on the run would be hell.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Might work.” Angevin made a sour face. “I have my doubts.”
She stared at the floor for a moment. When she looked up, her eyes were glistening.
“Why did he shut me out? Why didn’t he tell me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“In case it went to hell, he didn’t want you involved.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin’s anxious expression did a slow melt into despair.
She buried her face in her hands. “He puts his ass on the line for that cow,
but he can’t trust me enough to see him through!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Accessory after the fact.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Bonehead.” Angevin sniffled into her hands. “Is it too late
to volunteer for save-the-idiot duty? I can’t just sit around and wait for the
ax to fall—I have to do something.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani maneuvered into a crouch, stopping every so often to
let the private star show between her ears wink out. Her right knee popped as
she rose. “You know, he may be doing you a favor.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah.” Angevin straightened without any joints cracking.
“But I’m going where he’s going.” She smiled sadly. “Believe it or not, I
actually feel better. I thought he dumped me because he started sleeping with
Betha.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani bit her lip before <i class="calibre4">extreme stress has made people do
stranger things</i> slipped out. She checked herself in the mirror, dabbed cold
water on her bruise, then toweled her face in an effort to rub some life into
her ashen cheeks.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Of course,” Angevin continued with brittle gaiety, “if they
are having it off, they won’t have to worry about jail, will they?” She cracked
her knuckles, the sound amplified by the tile into a rapid-fire of gravel
crunches. “Let’s go,” she said as she clicked out of the bathroom.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Coming, Your Excellency.” Jani gave her face one last swipe
and tossed the towel into the sink.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani wanted to work off the last of her muddle, and Angevin
was pumping enough adrenaline to stock Neoclona for a month, so they walked the
underground route to Interior Main. It was well populated for that hour of the
morning. They passed grocery-laden skimtrollies, laundry and supply skiffs, and
other vehicles that inhabited the world beneath the buildings.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">All calm on the surface, but down here we have the
business end of the duck</i>. Jani walked quietly for a few minutes, her duffel
bouncing comfortably against her left hip, when an unpleasantly familiar sound
claimed her attention. She pulled up short as an overloaded skiff eased past
them, the whine of its lift array pitched dangerously high. She took off after
the vehicle, waving off Angevin’s protest.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re too heavy!” She pointed to the skiff’s cargo of a
huge, chocolate-hued truewood desk, topped with a bookcase for sauce and a
serving table as the tottering cherry. “Break that load down!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What?” The driver blinked at Jani as though coming out of a
daze. “I’m not going to haul this stuff all the way back to Private.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, you’re not. You’re going to unload that bookcase and
table right here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah, right,” the driver said. “In your dreams, lady.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t. Move.” Jani stared at the side of the driver’s face,
could almost hear the scrape of her grinding teeth. “You’ve had safety
training, I assume?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The woman’s glance flicked down at the vehicle’s dash, where
the load gauge must have been thumping red like an overworked heart. She
hesitated. “Yeah, but—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You know the damage that can occur when a mag shield fails
in an enclosed space? To systems? To nearby human brains? Yours and those of
all the poor innocents who just happen to be walking by?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yea—<i class="calibre4">yes</i>, but—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not to mention what could happen if the hyperacid fumes from
blown battery cells ooze along for the ride?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, <i class="calibre4">ma’am</i>, but—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Break that load down. Now.” Jani bit back the <i class="calibre4">Spacer</i>
just in time. Although it would have fit. The woman, close-cropped hair greyed
at the temples, coverall sleeves and pants legs knife-creased, had suddenly
developed the wild-eyed look of a person who had thought her order-taking days
long over. She stepped off the skiff, grapplers in hand, and started unloading
the table. The task began in grudging silence, although the words, <i class="calibre4">thought I
left this behind at fuckin’ Fort Sheridan</i> drifted down to Jani as she and
Angevin continued on their way to Main.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What the hell—?” Angevin glanced back at the muttering
driver. “You really did whack your head, didn’t you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What do you mean?” Jani asked. The last traces of nausea
had passed, taking with it the fuzzy-headedness and trembling in her thighs.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Were you in the Service? Jeez, she almost saluted you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, she didn’t.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I saw her arm tense. She wanted to.” Angevin shook her
head. “<i class="calibre4">I</i> wanted to.” She gave Jani a worried look. “Or maybe she just
wanted to belt you. But she didn’t. What are you? I mean, really?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I don’t think I know anymore</i>. Fingering through her sense
of calm, Jani detected an unwelcome edginess, the feeling of being <i class="calibre4">au point</i>.
As though the business end of her own duck paddled furiously, quacking for her
to wake up. <i class="calibre4">Something is wrong with me</i>. Something more than travel lag,
a stomach unsettled by stress and years of strange foods, a back wrenched by
too many cheap mattresses. “I’m just an Interior staffer on special
assignment,” she answered hastily, as she recalled again how the garage guy had
behaved in the days before his collapse.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah, ok. Whatever you say.” Angevin fell silent for a
time, then piped, “Wish you could bottle that voice—I’d buy it and use it on
Durian.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Muscles aches. Disorientation</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He’d shit himself. Twice.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Mood swings</i>? She’d been so tightly wrapped for so
long, how could she judge? <i class="calibre4">Chronic indigestion? Oh, hell</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then I’d use it on Steve. He’d never cut me out again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Am I really sick</i>? Jani shivered, even though the
tunnel air felt comfortably warm. <i class="calibre4">Dying</i>? She heard Angevin mutter
something about stupid shoes, and followed her to a vacant two-seater parked at
a mini-charge. Without thinking, Jani got in on the passenger side. Angevin
could drive. She didn’t feel up to it.
