<p class="NormalFirst">
“How the hell did you get in here?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve backed away, stumbled, and wound up straddling a
footstool. “I said, don’t yell—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m not yelling,” Jani said, just a touch louder than
necessary. “Start at the beginning. What happened after you ran out of the
cafeteria?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve’s nicstick puffed feebly. On the nearby coffee table,
a small dish contained the remains of several others. “Scarpered down the hall.
My office. Grabbed my shit and made for the stairs.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Did you pass Ginny Doyle on the way?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hell no.” He looked horrified at the prospect. “Wouldn’t be
here if I had, would I?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Don’t be too sure</i>. “The stairway lock let you
through?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah. Everything worked until I got to the first floor.
Heard running. Ducked into a doorway. Saw guards running in all directions.
Waited till they’d gone, then tried the stairway door again. Locked. I knew the
main exits would be sealed before I could reach them, so I made for the
delivery bays in the rear of the House.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“They were still open?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah. Food deliveries today. Skimvans inside, filling the
bays—skimvans outside lined up ten abreast, waiting to unload. In this weather,
they don’t shut down for anything. One of the supers saw me and started cussing
me out. Told me to get my ass into some coldgear and start unloading. So I
did.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So you got all muffled up and unrecognizable in a snowsuit
and nailed yourself a skiff.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve grinned. “Lucky, huh? I spent about a half hour
unloading. Worked my way through Oxbridge at the school docks, so I’m pretty
good at it. Super watched me for a few minutes, then left to squawk at somebody
else. Guards came through every once in a while. One stared right at me, but I
looked like I knew what I were doing. No one expects a nance dexxie to know how
to handle a loading skiff, do they?” His lip curled. “A few minutes later, I
steered the skiff outside, made like the battery were low, and drifted it to a
maintenance shed. Changed it for a grounds-crew skiff and floated down the
access road to here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani found herself listening with respectful interest. Then
she thought of Betha, and her mood soured.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Made for the tradesman’s entrance,” Steve continued.
“Housekeeper leaves coffee and snacks for the Private crews in a little back
room. I know because I stop by some days to check for blueberry tart. Outer
door’s always unlocked. Had to wait until someone came out to refresh the
pot—ducked in through the inner door while her back were turned. Up the lift.
Snuck in with the cleaners. Here I am.” He looked at Jani in surprise. “You
know, it really were easy to get in here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Doyle will love to hear it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you have to keep bringing her up?” Steve dug in his
trouser pocket and pulled out another ’stick, which he shoved into his mouth
without igniting. “How’s Ange?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“About what you’d expect.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Pissed as hell. Doyle giving her fits?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m sure she has her under surveillance. I hope you haven’t
tried to call her.” Steve shook his head. “Keep it that way. You both may go
crazy in the interim, but if you try to hook up, you’re screwed.” Jani waited
for his affirmative sigh. “So, you went straight from fourth floor to first?
Never got off on the third floor? Didn’t visit the repair carrels?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve gave her a puzzled look. “Nah. Didn’t have no bloody
time, Ris.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“When was the last time you were down there?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Last night. I stayed a while after you left. Had to turn in
my parts req.” His expression grew guarded. “Why?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A thin band of tension stretched from Jani’s scalp and down
her neck. “Betha’s dead. We found her body in your repair carrel about two
hours ago. She’d been strangled. The medical examiner put the time of death at
around midnight.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve tried to shake his head, but all he could manage was a
palsied tremor. “Why—why would someone want to hurt her?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I think she went behind your back and tried to work a deal
with someone.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Aw, no—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That someone killed her. The way she died suggested the
killer wanted something from her.” Jani sat on the arm of a chair and watched
the light play over her boot as she swung her leg to and fro. <i class="calibre4">Now I feel
better. It comes and goes in waves</i>. She looked up from her mesmerizing
footwear and into Steve’s frightened eyes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What do you mean, ‘way she died’? What do you mean, ‘wanted
something’?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I mean it took a while for whoever killed her to kill her.
They were trying to extract information from her.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Did they get it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, maybe I can give ’em some of what they need,” Steve
said as he ran from the room.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Steve!” Jani rushed after him, reaching him as he
disappeared into the bathroom. “Where do you think you’re going?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve had already pulled on one leg of a pair of snowpants.
Behind him, the lube-stained jacket lay in a heap on the floor. “Back to Main,”
he said as he shoved in the other leg, then yanked the thick grey pants up to
his waist. “I’m going to find whoever did this.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani leaned against the doorway, positioning herself to
throw a block if things needed to get physical. “I wouldn’t do that if I were
you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah? Why not?” Steve finished fastening his pants and pulled
the jacket over his head.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Because a lot of people back at Main think you did it.
Because Ridgeway tried to declare anarchy rules and order you killed if you
tried to escape from the compound, and while Doyle countermanded the ‘rules’
part, I’m not a hundred percent sure about the ‘kill’ part.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The furious movement beneath the jacket slowly subsided.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s become more than doc-jazzing, Steve. You’re wanted for
questioning in a murder.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The jacket sagged to the tiled floor. “Does Ange think—?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.” Jani moved out of her “brace” position. Steve didn’t
appear too eager to leave anymore. “The first thing she said was, ‘He didn’t do
it.’”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But that were the first thing she <i class="calibre4">thought</i>.” He
moaned softly. “She saw Betha?” He winced at Jani’s affirmative. “Is she ok?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She got sick. Doyle sent her to the infirmary. Personally,
I think she just wanted Angevin locked up as long as you still ran loose.” Jani
waited for Steve to reply, but he just stared over her shoulder. “That’s why
you have to stay here. Someone has committed murder and framed you for it. The
case is all circumstantial, but as the old saying goes, ‘Enough coincidence
will surely hang a man.’” Steve’s eyes finally moved to meet hers. They held
the dumb misery of a wounded animal, waiting for the killing blow. “Let’s go
into the other room, where we can talk.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani returned to the sitting room
while Steve removed his snowsuit. She sat carefully. Her back had begun to ache
again. <i class="calibre4">The wave comes in. The wave goes ou</i><i class="calibre4">t.</i> “Now, after you bolted, you went to the office to get your ’pack
and the papers,” she said, as Steve flopped into the chair across from her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He nodded. “Yeah, I had—I usually wear my ’pack on me, but
Ange and me, we got in sort of early, and after she parked in the garage, we
just stayed put and sat and talked and then—” A blush crept up his neck. “You
know.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani forced a smile. “Yeah, I know.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And when we got into the building, I realized I left my
belt and packpouch in her skimmer. Then we were running late, tryin’ to track
down Betha, so I locked my ’pack in my desk with the papers. Couldn’t carry ’em
around in my hand like my orb and bloody scepter, could I? Not with that
fookin’ lien.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where are the papers?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve’s face brightened a bit more. “They’re in the jacket.”
He bounded to his feet and headed back to the bathroom, returning with the
battered jacket. “I zipped it all in here. Thing’s got more pockets than a
snooker tournament.” He unzipped and rummaged; soon, the coffee table between
them held a scanpack in a scuffed case, an emergency ’pack tool kit, and a file
pouch bursting with handwritten notes, general-purpose paper, and—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Some of this stuff has the Prime Minister’s seal.” Jani
fingered a creamy white page. The familiar silky smoothness of government
parchment sent a shiver up her arm. “You’ve got original docs here. From
another damn House! From <i class="calibre4">the</i> damn House!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve stilled. “I know.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Eyes-only docs.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The Prime Minister’s eyes!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah, well. She didn’t seem to want to use them the way
they should’ve been.” Steve grimaced in disgust. “They followed her, you know.
The Lady. They knew something were wrong with her, and they just followed her
with scans and watched it unfold. She grew up with them, went to school with
them. Treated some of their kids. She were one of them, and they just watched
while she flamed out.” He shoved the doc pouch across the table. “Here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani flipped open the pouch. “Who compiled this?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Betha. The Lady helped with the personal stuff, but Betha
did more than you think.” Steve’s expression darkened further. “She had ways of
getting hold of stuff. She’d visit friends in other Houses and just go
wandering on her own. She said the things people left out on their desks would
scare you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani held up one of the PM’s documents. “Are you telling me
she just walked into Li Cao’s office, and said, ‘Excuse me, Your Excellency, do
you mind?’”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t know how she got that.” Steve fussed with a jacket
zipper. A plastic rasp cut the air. “She wouldn’t tell me. Just said she had
connections.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">She had connections, all right</i>. “Well, maybe she did
you a favor by not telling you,” Jani said as she flipped through a few more
cream white sheets. “We could have found you on the floor next to her.” The
image stalled Steve in mid-zip. He pushed the jacket to one side, mumbled
something about needing a drink, and escaped to the kitchenette.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani continued paging through the pile. The PM documents
contained information she already knew from the Court report. All of Lyssa’s
public missteps, and a few private ones, all neatly cataloged and
cross-referenced with her trips to Nueva Madrid. <i class="calibre4">So, Betha didn’t reach her
own brilliant conclusions—she stole them from an entire team of Prime analysts</i>.
She set the docs aside and rooted through the miscellaneous scraps.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Paper from Interior Grounds and Facilities, cataloging Lyssa’s
vehicular mishaps. Liquor bills. A listing of wrecked furniture. <i class="calibre4">Probably
blasphemy coming from a paper pusher, but some things shouldn’t be written down</i>.
Physician, wife, mother—all forgotten amid the damning slips of paper. Jani
brushed a stack of sheets aside, sending several of them fluttering to the
floor.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She picked
up one of the fallen documents, and a different sort of shiver moved up her
arm. <i class="calibre4">Consulate paper</i>. From Rauta Shèràa. She checked the date code in
the upper left corner. <i class="calibre4">I was still at Knevçet Shèràa then</i>. Yolan was
dead, but the rest of them were alive, battered and weaponless, waiting for
their Captain to keep her promise and see them safely home.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani touched the paper’s snow-white body, ran a finger along
the bright blue trim. A log excerpt, judging from its margins and formatting,
but without a Consulate cipher glossary, it would be impossible to break the
code. <i class="calibre4">They used semi-Rime iterations then</i>. With her ’pack and a
workstation, she could crack it eventually. <i class="calibre4">Could take a day, or a couple
thousand years</i>. She heard Steve clatter out of the kitchenette and folded
the document into the inside pocket of her jacket.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Find anything useful?” Steve asked as he twisted the cap
off a bottle of New Indiesian beer.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shrugged. “Nothing we don’t already know. I was
searching for Consulate paper from eighteen years ago.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve shook his head. “That’s that blue-and-white stuff? I
looked for that. There’s none in there. Betha said she had it in her half of
the files. Did anyone find it in the carrel?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not that I know of,” Jani said. “They could have been
wedged beneath her body, or hidden in one of the desk drawers.” But the desk
had been more a table; none of its drawers could have contained a file pouch
the size of the one she held. <i class="calibre4">And the one I’m holding didn’t have any
Consulate paper in it when Steve looked through it last night</i>. “Did you
sleep in your office last night?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve colored. “Yeah. Few hours. Didn’t want to go home.
Don’t like sleeping alone.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What time did you fall asleep?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Tennish. I remember because my ’zap’s recharge light were
blinking, and it weren’t when I woke.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And the cleaning crews come through about eleven?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“At my end of the floor, more like ten-thirty.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani plopped the doc pouch on the couch beside her and sat
back. <i class="calibre4">You had another visitor besides the cleaner</i>. She could imagine
Betha sneaking into Steve’s office, finding him asleep, and slipping the most
important piece of paper Lyssa had given her into his share of the info tangle.
<i class="calibre4">What were you up to, Betha</i>? Did she plan to withhold the most vital
piece of information from her other co-conspirator? <i class="calibre4">Of course</i>. But her
plan backfired. Her co-conspirator knew what to look for, knew what was
missing. <i class="calibre4">I need that cipher glossary</i>. “I have to go.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve stood. “I don’t suppose I can go with?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not a chance.” Jani pointed to a stack of paper that had
been growing steadily since her arrival. “There’s a three-day backlog of
newssheets. Please keep your hands off my workstation. I’ve typed it to me, but
I’m sure it’s monitored for intrusions. In fact, the whole damn suite could be
under monitoring. I try to check it a couple times a day, but it’s their
playpen. They know tricks I haven’t heard of.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“They airn’t gonna bug His Excellency’s guest!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“They’re not that considerate.” Jani walked over to the
holoVee and patted the top of the console. “Keep away from this. Don’t use the
comport, either. We don’t want signals coming out of this suite when they know
I’m not here to make them. Understand?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve sat down and dug out another ’stick. “Yes, Mother.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And if you’re going to keep smoking, do it in the
bathroom.” Jani cracked open her office door. “Stash the snowsuit in here. If
someone tries to get in here, you may have to dress <i class="calibre4">tout de suite</i> and go
out the window.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We’re on the second floor, Ris.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“There’s over two meters of snow on the ground. It’ll break
your fall.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Says you. They’re not your bloody ankles, are they?” Steve
sighed heavily. “Would they really shoot me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">At this point, they’re so damned spooked they’d take out
the entire Cabinet</i>. Jani pulled her shooter out of her duffel and handed it
to Steve. “Do you know how to use one of these?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Y-yeah.” His mouth gaped as he examined the bulky grip and
dated styling. “Crike, my dad has one of these. Thing’s a relic!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Thanks.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve’s look sharpened. “He got his in the Service.” But his
heart wasn’t in this particular attempt to badger Jani about her past. He
slumped back in his chair. “Would they really, really shoot me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani left Steve’s pained question unanswered and hurried to
the bathroom. <i class="calibre4">A quick splash of cold water on your face can take the place
of a nap</i>. Sure it could. She checked her films in the mirror, then examined
her face. <i class="calibre4">I look tired</i>. But the garage guy had looked sick. Sallow,
clammy skin. Bones jutting. And the delirium. Seeing Borgie as she had didn’t
qualify as delirium. Hearing him. That was stress. Augie. The sight of combat
weapons and dead bodies. She’d be fine as soon as she could manage some sleep.
She finished washing up. When she reentered the sitting room, Steve still sat
with the shooter cradled in his hands.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ris?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shouldered her duffel. The Consulate paper crackled
against her chest as she moved. “Yeah?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you sure you don’t want to keep this?” He held the
weapon out to her, taking care to keep the barrel pointed at the floor.
“Betha’s murderer may have wanted her and me out of the way for starters, but
you’re helping us. They might go after you now, too.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll be fine,” she said as she locked the door on the
worried young man. <i class="calibre4">Nobody can kill me—I’m never going to die</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Everybody dies, Captain</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Not me. I tried it once, remember—it didn’t take</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She hurried to the elevator. Her touchy stomach shuddered as
the car moved down, but the sensation soon passed. She hugged her duffel,
imagining the empty slot that usually held her shooter. She felt no regrets
over her decision to leave the weapon with Steve. Better he should have it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">The wave goes out . . . the wave comes in</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She wouldn’t need it anyway.
</p>
