<p class="NormalFirst">
“Do you have anything to declare, madam?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani edged away from the half-opened door, which led to the
Customs check-in booths reserved for “personal interviews,” and left the young
Commerce staffer and her husband, both sweaty and shaken, to their fates. <i class="calibre4">They
know you’re smuggling something, dears—may as well give it up</i>. Once a
Customs inspector began addressing you formally, all bets were off.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My guess is collectibles or jewelry</i>. Jani had
followed the couple since they’d docked at Luna. Well dressed and parcel-laden,
they had shunned the bullet cars that would have taken them to the shuttle
docks’ VIP section in minutes, preferring instead the hike through two
kilometers of walkways.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani had followed them, curiosity egging her on even as
fatigue set in, aggravating her limp. She watched them shift packages and
whisper frantically, and waited out their frequent restroom stops, stifling the
urge to sneak up behind them and shout, “<i class="calibre4">Boo</i>!” Instead, she’d trailed
them into the deceptively comforting confines of the lounge, and waited.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Within minutes, a Treasury Customs official, dark gold
uniform making him look like a tarnished elf, interrupted the pair’s
exploration of the buffet and led them away.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">The restroom stops tipped Customs off</i>. Scancams lined
the public walkways of shuttle stations, but they were unobtrusive and easily
ignored by fatigued travelers now a mere five-hour hop from home. Amateurs.
Like any game, smuggling had its rules. You followed them, or you paid the
penalty.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She cut down the short hallway and entered the spacious
lounge. Collecting a cup of tea and a sandwich from the extravagant buffet, she
searched for a seat near the wall-spanning window. In the distance, the Lunar
shipyards gleamed in the unfiltered sunlight with molten force, drawing the
attention of most of the waiting passengers as construction sites always did.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani settled into a recently vacated chair, the documents
case between her feet, duffel in her lap. Residual stranger-warmth soaked into
her lower back. She took a bite of her sandwich, some sort of smoked fish with
herbed mayonnaise. <i class="calibre4">Good, but Lucien could have done better</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien. Pascal. Her excellent steward’s real name. After
several more failed attempts to bug Jani’s cabin, followed by futile efforts to
gain access to her duffel and documents case, he had proposed a truce, which
she had accepted. Life aboard the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> became more conventional after
that, though no less interesting. Watching Lucien operate within the strict
hierarchy of the Cabinet ship’s Service crew had proven educational. He never
broke rules. He never bucked authority. But things got done his way, usually by
people who should have known better.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He had even finagled her some Interiorwear that actually
fit, like the grey-and-white wrapshirt and trousers she wore. A courtesy, he
had told her, from one professional to another.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I almost preferred it when he was trying to gig me—it
took my mind off my work</i>. Evan’s files. She understood why he had been so
reluctant to let her see them. There had been some dealings with a junior
member of the Justice Ministry that wouldn’t have borne the weight of a public
inquiry, as well as personal financial hopscotch of the sort that implied tax
evasion. It had taken her almost two weeks just to sort out the intricacies of
the accounting involved. The NorthPort Haárin could have learned something from
Evan’s financial advisor.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But even so, she’d seen worse. Certainly nothing to merit a
death. There had already been too many. First, Evan’s and Lyssa’s children,
drowned during their efforts to sail an antique boat during a summer holiday.
Two boys and a girl—ages fourteen, twelve, and ten. Martin, Jerrold, and
Serena.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Then came Lyssa. Official record confirmed the gossip. The
woman’s behavior had become increasingly erratic over the past two years.
Unexplained disappearances. Rumors of drug abuse. Hushed-up accidents.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But all the documents scanned within normal variation</i>.
Nothing to suggest tampering. Nothing to merit a murder. <i class="calibre4">Have I proved your
fears unfounded already, Evan</i>? As things now stood, Lyssa died a broken woman’s
death, driven by past tragedy.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani watched construction workers flit along a future
commercial transport’s spindly framework, one beat ahead of the immense robot
ganglion that did the actual hoisting, joining, and fastening. No matter how
well-programmed the ’bot, however fuzzified the thinking, human supervision was
still required. No robot was capable of seeing the overall picture. Ultimately,
it only knew what it was told.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani watched a moon-suited human dodge and weave about one
of the arms like an armored gnat . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I sense an effort to lead me by the nose</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
. . . ensuring that the arm moved in the
correct direction and hit the chosen target.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">His initials are Durian Ridgeway</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani finished her sandwich. She hoped she hadn’t wasted
almost five weeks working with half the data, but she knew that hope was
misplaced. She had slipped an urgent meeting request, coded to Evan’s
attention, into the queue of scrambled messages transmitted to Chicago every
half hour. But she doubted she would receive a reply before her shuttle left
in—she checked her timepiece—forty-five minutes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you have anything to declare?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani turned toward the voice. On the far side of the lounge,
Customs clerks moved among the waiting passengers, logging colonial purchases,
calculating tariffs, handing out receipts. She exhaled with a shudder. Augie
notwithstanding, she hadn’t been breathing very easily the past few minutes.
But she could relax now. The sending-out-of-the-clerks meant all those who
merited more personal attention from Customs had already been winnowed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I wonder how my young couple is doing</i>? Had the body
cavity scans begun? Attorneys been contacted?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you have anything to declare?” Chipper voices grew
closer. Paper rustled. Recording boards chirped. “Anything at all?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">If you only knew</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Nothing?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Not an issue, now. You had your shot and missed. Go away</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you quite sure?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Yes. My secrets remain mine. I am Jani Moragh Kilian.
Captain. United Services. C-number
S-one-two-dash-four-seven-dash-one-seven-nine-D. Sideline Service, assigned to
Rauta Shèràa Base, First Documents and Documentation Division. Not a real
soldier</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Anything else?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Eighteen years ago, in a place called Knevçet Shèràa,
during the height of the idomeni civil war, I killed my commanding officer in
self-defense. His name was Rikart Neumann—Colonel—Gisela Detmers-Neumann’s
uncle. She and others would perhaps take exception to the self-defense
argument, but since they’re aware of the events that precipitated the
shoot-out, they may not dare voice such</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you have anything to declare?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">The Laumrau panicked when they learned of Neumann’s death</i>.
First they lobbed “pink”; the microbe infested and disabled all the weapons,
environmental, and communication arrays. Then came the shatterboxes. <i class="calibre4">The
Laumrau had secrets to bury, which are none of your concern. All you need know
is that, in the process, they buried my corporal. She died when a wall
collapsed on her. Corporal Yolan Cray, Mainline Service, Twelfth Rover Corps,
C-number M-four-seven-dash-five-six-dash-two-eight-six-R</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m ready, miss—please continue.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">One idomeni day later, I killed twenty-six Laumrau in an
effort to save my remaining troops. The deaths were not “clean” as far as the
Laumrau were concerned. No human had ever become involved in one of their
skirmishes before—the resulting disorder upset them. Since I had violated the
Bilateral Accord, the Service would have turned me over to the idomeni for
trial followed by inevitable execution, but</i>—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m sorry, miss, could you speak up, please?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
—<i class="calibre4">but the transport carrying me and my troops from Knevçet
Shèràa to Rauta Shèràa exploded on takeoff</i>. Lift-array failure. Everyone
gone. All her real soldiers. <i class="calibre4">I know their C-numbers, too</i>. All fourteen
of them. <i class="calibre4">Do you want to hear them, too</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s not necessary, ma’am. Please continue.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I, however, did not die</i>. Not medically, anyway. <i class="calibre4">Three
doctors salvaged me from the wreckage, for reasons that would shock you to your
core. They pieced me together and hid me in a hospital basement in Rauta
Shèràa’s human enclave. As I healed, the tide of civil war turned, and the
Laumrau lost to the Vynshà</i>. Laumrau descended to Laum, and Vynshà ascended
to Vynshàrau. <i class="calibre4">No one fights to avenge the
deaths of the losers.</i> Not even the well-ordered idomeni.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But they remembered. They called her <i class="calibre4">kièrshia</i>, she’d
learned later. Toxin. <i class="calibre4">You don’t want to allow me within your
perimeter—everything I touch dies</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you have anything to declare?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">The pennies on my eyes</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you have anything to declare?” The smiling Customs clerk
stationed himself beside Jani’s chair, recording board in hand, beaming in a
way that reminded her of Lucien.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Just these.” Jani removed some pieces of truesilver
jewelry, purchased in a hurried swoop through a pricey Felix Station shop, from
the side pocket of her duffel. With cheerful efficiency, the clerk scanned the
information from the still-attached price tags into his board’s data bank and
totaled the tariff. Jani just as cheerfully rattled off the Interior account to
which the tariff could be billed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Rule One: Always have something hefty to declare to throw
them off</i>. Transaction completed, receipt tucked away, Jani settled back and
watched the construction workers hover and dart like metallic bees around a
skeletal hive. <i class="calibre4">Take it from an old smuggler</i>. She sipped the tea, winced
at its bitterness, and waited for her boarding call.
</p>

</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
“Admit it, Jani. You’d never seen anything like it in your
life. All those old skyscrapers! All that history!” Evan bustled her out onto
the glass-walled balcony that adjoined his office and pointed out his view,
which included both the Chicago skyline and the nearby lake. “I hope you got a
chance to see the memorial to the Greatest War on the way in.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani took in the curious array of oddly shaped buildings,
all obscured by wind-whipped snow. “You mean ‘The War of Family Aggression,’
don’t you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“There were no Families back then, Jani,” Evan said
patiently.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. They came later.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I seem to recall us having this discussion before.” Evan
sighed. “Politics aside, it’s worth a visit. It’s a liquiprism obelisk that
changes color on the hour. Really quite striking.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Evan, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but it’s not
sight-seeing weather.” Jani looked out at the lake, which had taken on a
churning, milky grey life of its own. “If this balcony wasn’t enclosed and well
heated, we’d be icicles within seconds.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, but it’s home.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not for me.” She turned her back on his fallen face.
“Sorry—didn’t mean to rain on your birthday.” She hesitated at the office
entry. <i class="calibre4">Why do I feel like I just kicked a puppy</i>? “I’m sure it must be
very nice. In the spring.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, it is.” Evan hurried to her side. “The parks. The
arboretums. You’d love it here in the spring.” He escorted her back into his
retreat’s soothing blue-and-green depths. “I gathered your ride here from
O’Hare was more exciting than you may have liked.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s an understatement.” Jani sank into a chair across
from Evan’s desk. “Nothing like a collision with split batteries to disrupt the
flow of traffic on a twelve-lane skimway. Then the HazMat unit came. Then this
storm. At least it held off until after I landed.” She shuddered. “I think my
driver has a death wish. I’d yank her license.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan perched on the edge of his desk. “Quite an indictment,
coming from you. I blamed my first grey hairs on our sojourns through Rauta
Shèràa.” That little <i class="calibre4">bon mot</i> launched, he eased behind his desk and
kicked back. “Chicago is the Commonwealth capital, Jani. Over seventeen million
people live within the metroplex limits. I can’t tell you the exact square kilometers
offhand, but the number borders on the ridiculous.” His look turned concerned.
“I hadn’t considered culture shock. Are you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Shocked by the wonder of it all? I’ll live.” Jani massaged
the hard knot in the back of her neck where augie had planted his foot. She had
coped with the throbbing red lights on the emergency vehicles well enough, but
the sirens had gotten to her. She held out her hands. The right one had finally
stopped shaking. The left one had never started. <i class="calibre4">Half-sane, at least, but
which half</i>? “Does this place have a gym? Exercise helps.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Five. I’ll get you a pass for the one I use—it has the best
equipment.” He picked absently at his fingernails. “We have a decent medical
staff, as well,” he added carefully. “All Neoclona-trained.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">No</i>, thank you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, for crying out loud, stop acting like an idomeni!”
Evan’s voice rasped with irritation. “What, I’m not your physician-priest, so
you can’t talk to me? When was the last time you had your augmentation
evaluated? Any augmented vet who works for Interior has to be checked out every
six months and have at least one precautionary take-down per year.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Forget it. Look, I received enough doctoring after the
crash to last a lifetime. Half my limbs and most of my insides were grown in a
tank. I’m sick of the smell of antiseptic, poking and prodding, and white
sheets, not necessarily in that order. And forget any damned take-down. No
one’s going to stick a blinking box in my face and short out my brain for my
own good. I’ve had it. And speaking of ‘had it.’” She gave Evan a brief rundown
of her thoughts with regard to his files. His headshaking grew more and more
pronounced each time Jani alluded to the possibility that Durian Ridgeway had
purposely withheld information.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I can’t accept that!” Evan’s feet hit the carpeted floor
with a muffled <i class="calibre4">thud</i>. “Durian knows how important this is. Hell, he has
as much to lose as I do if things fall to pieces. He’s been cleaning up after
me for so long, his nickname around here is <i class="calibre4">the janitor</i>. Everyone knows
if I show up, he’s never far behind. We’re joined at the hip—if I go, he goes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh goodie—I’ve come between a dog and his man</i>. And
between both of them and what? Jani stared at Evan until he broke eye contact
and began pushing his pen stand back and forth. “You’re still holding out on
me.” She worked her hands over the brocaded upholstery that covered the arms of
her chair. Only her right could detect the changes in texture.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Have you forgotten what <i class="calibre4">I</i> have to lose if things
fall to pieces?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">No one could possibly</i>—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m wanted by the Service for mutinous murder and
desertion. No dust has ever settled on that warrant. It’s reposted every six
Common months without fail in every colonial Government Hall. Wherever I
happened to be, I’d stop by, keep myself company.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know it must—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Funny how oddly comforting I found it at times. Like a
touchstone—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Will you shut up!” Evan’s face had taken on a hunted look.
“I didn’t want to tell you this. Knowing how you may react, I’m still not sure
I should.” The pen stand jerked and shook. “Exterior’s looking for you, Jan. I
arrived on Whalen only twelve hours ahead of a cruiser carrying members of
Ulanova’s executive staff. I heard rumors of a Service ship trolling the area
as well, but I couldn’t confirm them.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani crossed her legs to ease the pressure on her lower
back. <i class="calibre4">You’d think a Cabinet House would have better chairs</i>. “Why now, I
wonder?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan’s brow furrowed. “You don’t seem surprised.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shook her head. “My record states, ‘missing, assumed
dead.’ The gulf between that and ‘declared dead’ is very wide.” She poked her
numb left arm. “No remains were ever found. No indestructible Service ID chip
was recovered from the wreckage and canceled out. The Admiral-General doesn’t
know for sure I’m dead; therefore, I am alive. That’s why the outstanding
warrant. That’s why a rep gets sent out to follow up every rumor of my
existence. I killed my CO. Then I violated the Bilateral Accord by interfering
in idomeni affairs. Those are two biggies, Ev. You may think they’ve given up
on me, but you’re wrong. They’re not going to rest until they nail me to the
wall.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan’s expression grew confused. “What I don’t understand is
how Shroud and his buddies managed to keep you hidden? What did they think they
played at?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I remember them standing outside my door, when they
thought I couldn’t hear. Laughing, calling one another Dr. Frankenstein</i>.
No, she took that back. John never laughed. “I don’t know how they did it. I
think it was all a game to them; an escape from the boredom. Most of the humans
had been evac’d by that time. They had nothing to do. So they built themselves
a friend.” She walked over to the bar and poured herself a glass of water. She
gulped the cold liquid, felt it cool her from within. It took her some time to
realize Evan had remained silent. She turned to find him staring at her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What do you mean by ‘friend’? Tell me what I’m thinking
didn’t happen. Please tell me they didn’t—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“They didn’t, Evan. Parini’s homosexual and DeVries only
likes blondes with big tits.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What about Shroud? I knew him back then, you know. From his
visits to the Consulate. He was strange then, and he hasn’t improved with
time.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I knew him, too. A little.” If encounters in the entryway
of Nema’s house counted as “knowing.” <i class="calibre4">He’d mumble, “Hello,” and stare at the
floor</i>. Poor John. Funny the things she remembered. How hands that performed
the most delicate medical procedures could turn so clumsy when working under a
different sort of pressure. “It’s over. Why worry about it? What am I going to
do, sue for malpractice?” She returned to the bar and poured herself more
water, this time adding ice.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I guess I understand your medical phobia now,” Evan said.
“I’m surprised they let you escape.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“They didn’t. I slipped away during the final blitz.” Jani leaned
against a bookcase. The odor of the leather binding seemed especially sharp,
almost meaty. “Remember?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan nodded slowly. “The Night of the Blade. The Vynshà sent
the Haárin into Rauta Shèràa first. Debriding the wound, they called it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani picked up the thread. “They had set up observation
points in the hills. I could see the halolamps flashing signals to the Haárin
in the city center.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan gaped. “They let you walk the streets!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I wasn’t walking. More like limping double time.” She tried
to smile. “They didn’t want humanish at that point, anyway. They had other
concerns.” She looked at Evan, sitting hunched over his desk. “Where were you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The sub-basement of the Consulate. We’d been down there for
eleven idomeni days. Almost two weeks. The Service got us out at dawn, as the
Vynshà entered the city proper. They’d just declared themselves ‘rau,’ and set
fire to the ring the Haárin had erected around Rauta Shèràa’s perimeter. We
could see the flames from the transport windows.” He swallowed. “There were
bodies in that ring.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not all of them were dead, either.” Jani walked away from
the bookcase. The odor of the books was making her sick to her stomach. “The
ring of souls released by cleansing fire. Supposed to guarantee peace and
protection until the next imbalance of power.” She looked out the balcony
window. The wind still whipped, blowing so much snow that the view looked like
a malfunctioning holoVee screen. A roaring gust rattled the panes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
It was Evan’s turn to visit the bar. He ignored the water
pitcher and reached for the bourbon. “That convergence on Whalen may not mean
anything. The way things have been going lately, a display of any type of
proficiency with things idomeni would have been enough to attract attention.
Ulanova may just be looking for translators.” He poured himself a single shot,
downed it, then paused to catch his breath. “I slipped a decoy into
NorthPort—one of my own people—to distract them.” He frowned. “She was one of
my best Vynshà-watchers. I’m going to miss her. Probably take us months to get
her back.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sorry for the inconvenience.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan smiled. He hefted the bourbon decanter as though
testing its weight, then set it back in its place in the bottle rack. “I think
I know what Durian removed from the files. And I know where to find it. You’ll
have it by tonight.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you going to confront him?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. Not yet. He’s not here now, anyway. He and Ange are
flying in later today from London. A visit to his family, I believe.” He
flinched as another gust shook the balcony panes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">That was Hansen Wyle exploding out of his grave</i>. “A
visit to <i class="calibre4">chez</i> Ridgeway? <i class="calibre4">Really</i>?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Durian’s relationship with Angevin is completely
professional,” Evan huffed defensively. “You just don’t like him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He doesn’t like me either. He tried to trip me up on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>.
He threw some Josephani at me. I pretended I couldn’t understand his accent.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Did you have a chance to study those language discs I
slipped into your documents portfolio?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s not the point!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. No, you’re right. I’ll have a talk with him.” He leaned
against the bar. “Jani, nobody here knows you except me. In any case, no one
who knew you eighteen years ago could place you now. Your face is completely
different, your hair. You’ve lost weight—hell, you even look <i class="calibre4">taller</i>.”
His aimless stare came to rest on her and sharpened. “You’re safe. I’ll keep
you safe.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani raised her glass in a mock toast, took a last sip, and
headed for the door. “I need to walk off my Chicago driving adventure. I’ll see
you later.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She turned to find Evan had opted for the second bourbon
after all.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You really killed Riky Neumann?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But he drew first? It was self-defense?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“His hand went to his holster. I wasn’t going to wait to
discover whether he was serious or just bluffing. Considering I’d just threatened
to declare anarchy rules, relieve him of command, and place him under arrest, I
don’t think he was simply trying to gauge my reaction.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Anarchy rules? <i class="calibre4">You</i> were going to take over command?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The integrity of the documents in my care was threatened. I
saw no other alternative. I was within my rights.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan downed his second shot. His face flushed. “You killed
him over a paper issue?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re upset because he was a Family member?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He was my father’s best friend. I grew up calling him Uncle
Rik.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And I served under him. Apparently he made a better uncle
than commanding officer.” Jani rifled through her pockets for her key card. Her
duffel and documents case waited outside in a locked desk. “I’ll see you
tonight. In the meantime, I think I’ll explore.” She left without looking back.
She knew what she’d see if she did. Evan, with his puzzled expression,
liquor-fueled curiosity, and unspoken question. <i class="calibre4">Why, Jani</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
