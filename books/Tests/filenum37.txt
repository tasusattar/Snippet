<p class="NormalFirst">
Evan stood at the bar in his dimly lit office. “Excuse
me,” he said peevishly when he realized he had company. “I don’t recall
requesting a med—” He tensed as Jani stepped forward. “Jan.” He offered a weak
smile. “Glad to see you’re up and about.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani let the doc pouch fall to the carpet. Tried to let it
fall. The nappy material had stuck to the carrier that had crusted on the end
of her stump; she wound up having to rip it away. Cloth parted company from
synthetic flesh with a keening rasp. Evan moaned and gripped the edge of the
bar with both hands. His eyes squinched shut.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No one even tried to stop me, Evan. Did you ever get the
feeling you were being set up?” She walked to the sitting area near his desk.
“Have a seat. Bring your bottle. You may need it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan remained in place for a time, breathing slowly, eyes
still closed. When he opened them, he looked at Jani sidelong, sighing when he
saw her settled into a chair.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What did you think I was, Ev, a symptom?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.” He gathered up a glass and decanter. “That would have
implied good luck. Mine ran out long ago.” He sat in the chair across from her
and deposited his glassware on a side table. “What’s this about a setup?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I think certain people wanted me to come here. Tie up loose
ends, save them the trouble.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I hope you listened to the message I sent last night. It’s
true, you know. I do love you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re a liar.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You think so? You wouldn’t say that if you’d heard the
fights Durian and I had over you. When we figured out you might be alive, he
wanted to send someone to Whalen to kill you. I had to bribe him to leave you
alone. I promised to wangle him a spot on the ballot in the next general election.
Seems he has dreams of a deputy ministry. For starters.” His hand shook. Ice
rattled like chattering teeth. “I tried to convince him he operated better
behind the scenes, but he insisted. I’m afraid exposure to the voting public is
going to prove a shock for old Durian.” He looked at Jani, taking care to avoid
her mangled arm. “I’m hanging my janitor out to dry. That alone should convince
you I’m sincere.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You may have had a sincere moment or two in your life,
Evan. I doubt they involved me.” Without warning, Jani’s left shoulder jerked.
A sharp pain sang down her arm, flicked around her wrist, cramped her fingers.
“I was just something to shake in your father’s face.” She looked down at her
left thigh. Her left hand rested there. She could feel its weight, its
trembling. She just couldn’t see it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“As I recall, you enjoyed upsetting your colony friends with
me, as well.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It doesn’t matter.” She watched the hand that wasn’t there.
Gradually, the shuddering eased to an occasional twitch. “It was a long time
ago.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I didn’t think you’d trust me right away. I’m not an idiot,
Jan.” Evan emptied his glass. “I thought after you settled in, got used to
things, realized how I felt, you’d see how good you could have it here.” He
cast a longing look toward the decanter. “Now, here it is, three days later.
Plaster’s flaking off the ceiling, and knickknacks are clattering on the
shelves. The end is near.” His eyes grew liquid as tears brimmed. “How much
longer do I have?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not long.” Jani poked her left thigh with her invisible
hand, felt the tiny impacts against her phantom fingertips. “Doyle’s set the
wheels in motion. She always suspected your complicity in Lyssa’s death. She’s
working for someone else, by the way. Your Virginia. Service plant, maybe. Or
else she’s thrown in with one of the other Houses.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The comment fired some life back into Evan’s face. His jaw
firmed; his eyes sharpened. “Which one?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Your guess is worth more than mine. I’m surprised your
janitor hadn’t already flushed that out.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where is Durian, by the way? We were supposed to meet
fifteen minutes ago.” Evan waited for Jani to answer, fidgeted with his glass
when she didn’t. “I didn’t kill Lyssa, Jan. She had evidence of my sins hidden
all over the city. She told me if anything happened to her, she had someone in
place to insure the evidence would be sent to the right people.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That person was Betha Concannon.” Jani etched figures in
the air with her invisible fingers. “Bad choice on her part—Betha worked for
Durian. Now Betha’s dead.” Her hand started to ache from the exercise. She
stopped flexing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And Durian? He always notifies me when he’ll be late. This
isn’t like him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m sure there’s a reasonable explanation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If there is, I’d like to hear it, please.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani held both her hands out in front of her. The one she
could see felt the same as the one she couldn’t. “The alliance with Ulanova
changed things with regard to Lyssa. With her aunt’s backing, she became
dangerous, instead of merely embarrassing.” She straightened her left leg,
shook the pins-and-needles feeling from her left foot. Funny that life should
return to it now, when the rest of her felt so dead. “Do you remember that play
they ran at the Consulate the night we met?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani.” Evan watched her flex, then reached for the
decanter. “<i class="calibre4">Becket</i>,” he said as he poured. Liquor splashed against the
ice and onto the table. “It was <i class="calibre4">Becket</i>.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Becket</i>.” Sharp sounds. Jani had to concentrate in
order to repeat them without softening them into Vynshàrau. <i class="calibre4">Mbe-heth</i>. “I
remember you liked it. I found it stupid. Man hires his friend to do a job,
then gets pissed when said friend actually does it. And now look at us.” Her
chest felt tight. “Life imitates art.” She touched her right arm. Even through
the medcoat sleeve, it felt hot, swollen.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan leaned toward her. “Are you all right, Jan? Your lips
are turning blue.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m fine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Your eyes don’t look right. There’s a shooter graze on your
cheek.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m fine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where’s Durian?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I think I know what happened.” Jani stared at Evan until he
eased back. “You and Durian were talking. You’d just found out Lyssa had made
the connection between your comlog entry and my transport crash. With Ulanova’s
help, she’d bring you down. After all, it was your big sin. No Acton to blame
for this one—it was your call. You could have stopped it and you didn’t.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My father—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—was three weeks from Shèrá on the fastest ship he had. You
could have handled it. Missed messages. Lost records. Lied. But no. You wanted
to be the hero. The one who pulled the van Reuter nuts out of the fire.” Jani
hesitated as her heart skipped a beat. In that instant, her breathing eased.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Hey, augie</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Hey, Cap</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I didn’t know you were on that transport.” Evan reached out
to her. “Riky told me he’d keep you out of it. He promised me—I made him
promise when you left the city with him. Then I didn’t hear from him anymore.
No answer to the messages I sent him, and the ones from my father started
coming in one an hour. Always the same. ‘Do something, boy—we’re depending on
you. Act like a van Reuter for once.’” Evan’s own breathing grew ragged. “Jani,
I was alone. Scared. I’d acted as go-between for Rik and Dad—that made me
culpable. Violating the Bilateral Accord was a treasonous offense. I faced
prison. Maybe worse. I didn’t know what else to do!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani heard a familiar sound filter in from the anteroom. The
sizzling crack of a shooter. “I didn’t know what else to do, either.” One
report. Another. Another. <i class="calibre4">Twenty-six times. Before the dawn I will have
fired twenty-six times</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“They’re all dead, Jan. We’re still alive.” Evan knelt
before her, his hands closing over her visible one. “You said you wanted to
remember what happened. You can do that here just as well as in prison. If you
feel you have to suffer to make it count, trust me, you will. You’ll have to
bury yourself somewhere in Chicago. I’ll have to resign. But I’ll know you’re
here, and we’ll be able to get together eventually. After the dust settles.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani eased out of Evan’s grip. “You knew. All of it. About
the patients. About Lyssa. Betha. When you left me that message ordering me to
stop my investigation—Durian had just told you he’d killed her, hadn’t he?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jan, I didn’t mean for any of it to happen.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She caressed the side of his face, ran her thumb over his
unshaven cheek. He closed his eyes, rested his head on her knee, didn’t even
flinch as her hand slipped down around his neck. “I watched a man destroy his
face with his bare hands. I helped pull what was left of my corporal from
beneath tons of rubble. Evan,” she said as he looked up, “there are some things
you can’t negotiate away.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jan—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She pushed him away. “What was the name of Becket’s friend?
The king?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan glanced toward the door. “Henry.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Henry.” Jani could feel the heat generated by too many
people pressed into the Consulate auditorium, hear the rustle of evening gowns.
“The one scene I remember. Henry’s with his friends, his knights. His janitors,
like Ridgeway was your janitor—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What do you mean, ‘was’?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—and I’m sure you were drunk, like he was. Henry the king,
losing his grip—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—looking for someone to blame—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—knowing if she were dead, your problems would be over.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Please!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Will no one rid me of this dam-ned priest.” Jani’s soft
voice rang like a shout in her ears. “Lyssa and Betha. Make that dam-ned <i class="calibre4">priests</i>.”
Or maybe the reverberation was only in her head. “So Ridgeway maneuvered his
mops and buckets and rid you of your priests. Ulanova didn’t know about the
comlog. You were home free.” She coughed. Her arm ached again, but it no longer
felt hot. Quite the opposite. She shivered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani?” Evan had slunk back to his chair. “Where is Durian
now?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I left him in his office.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh. Are you going to leave me in my office, too?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.” Jani watched Evan’s gaze flick toward the door again.
“They want me to kill you, I think. Whoever Ginny works for. Whichever of your
colleagues is most fed up with you. But God, I really hate being maneuvered,
and I’ll be damned if I’ll be the tool for another Family bastard.” She smiled.
“Besides, you knew. And you’ll remember, too. That’s the one thing we’ll always
have in common.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan swallowed. “We could have more,” he said carefully. “We
could have everything again—” He shot out of his chair, trying to dart past her
to the door. But he moved too slowly, like Ridgeway had. Jani rose, kicked out,
caught the side of his knee. The joint cracked with the wet snap of damp wood.
He fell to the carpet and lay gasping, thumping the floor with his fist.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She waited until he looked at her with pain-glazed eyes. “I
don’t want to kill you. I want us both alive when they come. I want you around
for a long time. Now I’ll have someone to share my ghosts with.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan’s shallow breathing gradually slowed, deepened. Jani
couldn’t say the same for her own. Her chest felt heavy. Her left leg cramped.
Her right leg was the numb one now. She sat back down, and waited.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Captain Kilian?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The voice came from the other side of the door. A man’s
voice. She didn’t recognize it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Captain Kilian, I’m going to open the door. I want you to
come out here. Please advance slowly and keep your hands where I can see them.
That’s for your own good as well as mine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Mine</i>? Did that mean her visitor was alone? Augie
tried to rattle Jani’s bones in anticipation of a struggle, but she couldn’t
oblige with the customary battle chill. The only chill she felt left her clammy
and numb. Dark patches flecked before her eyes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Captain?” The office door hushed open. “Please come out.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She struggled to her feet. With every incremental rise, the
dark patches waxed, then waned. As she took her first steps, the room seemed to
tilt. She grabbed the chair for support.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Captain?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A different voice now. Its source filled the doorway. Tall.
Blond. Steel blue uniform wrapped around a steel blue spine. Red tabs on either
side of his collar. Matching red wounds on his cheek.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Lieutenant Pascal,” she said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien fingered his shooter, still encased in the holster at
his side. Then he drew to attention and snapped a salute, the sort that made
stiff Service polywool crack like a wind-whipped flag on a pole.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani touched her forehead in return. “Save it for the A-G,
Lieutenant. Allow me what’s left of my sideline pride.” The floor seemed to
shift as though she walked across a deflating pontoon. She turned, found
herself within striking distance of another man. Shorter. Stockier. Black hair.
Beard trimmed to a sharp point. He offered a courtly bow.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Dr. Calvin Montoya, Captain.” He wore medwhites, carried a
large pouch slung over one shoulder, held a large, featureless black cube in
his hand. His dark eyes narrowed as he studied her face, then her mangled arm.
“I’ve been charged with seeing you safe.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh.” Jani looked from Montoya to the cube, then back. “How
is John?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The point of Montoya’s beard twitched. “He’s as ever. I’ll
tell him you inquired. I’m sure he’ll be—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Surprised?” She looked down at the cube again. “Time for
the take-down? Well, Doctor, let’s get it over with.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.” Montoya’s expression turned relieved. “I think we
need to hurry.” He held up the cube and fingered one side. Red lights glittered
across the face Jani could see. “Watch the lights, Captain. Don’t turn away.
Concentrate on the sound of my voice and watch the lights.” As Montoya
continued to murmur directions, a tracery of red, like shooting stars, played
across the cube face. Jani found herself tracking the flickering as a flower
follows its sun. Her knees weakened.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Watch the lights, Captain. Don’t turn away. Watch—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Patterns played, each more rapidly. Songs to her brain.
Phantom pains shot through limbs destroyed long ago. Around her, flames
flashed. Sounds. Yolan’s scream as the wall collapsed. Smells. The nose-searing
acridity of hyperacid. The stench of burning flesh.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Come to the light, Captain,” said the voice from the other
side of the flashing red. “Don’t fight it, or you’ll feel—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sicker. Yes, I know, Doctor.” Jani took a slow step
forward. The odor of berries enveloped her, overwhelming her taste and smell,
overpowering the stinging smoke. Her vision tunneled, blocking out the flames,
the tumble of falling debris.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Only her hearing remained true. The hardiest sense, John had
told her. The last sense to die.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">See you soon, Captain</i>, Yolan said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, Corporal,” the Captain replied, as the last flicker of
red winked out.
</p>
