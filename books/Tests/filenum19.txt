<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_28">Chapter 15</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
A still-pouting Claire poked her head into the hallway and
motioned for Jani to follow. They passed through a series of sitting rooms,
each larger and more ornately furnished than the last, ending up in a <i class="calibre4">salon
grande</i> with crimson fabric-covered walls and museum-quality furnishings.
Jani looked at the muraled ceiling and berugged floor. <i class="calibre4">Everything’s freaking
red—I dub thee the Bloodshot Room</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You wait here,” Claire said as she departed, whipping her
waist-length hair like an animal repelling flies.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shrugged off her snowsuit jacket, gave up on the pants,
then flexed her neck and worked her stiff shoulders. An odd languor had settled
over her, an unsettling contrast to her usual post-augie jitters. <i class="calibre4">At least I
won’t go bouncing off these goddamn walls</i>. She listened for approaching
footsteps, then stared blearily at the fragile glass and porcelain contents of
the cabinets.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
When that palled, she switched her attention to the wall
decor. She contemplated several holos, their colors calibrated to resemble the
mutedness of old oils, before stopping in front of the portrait of a young man.
He wore a plain tunic in Exterior burgundy; his clipped hair shone white-blond.
Full-lipped, his professional smile held a hint of dry humor. Jani couldn’t see
the color of his slanted eyes, but a long-forgotten fragment of Commonwealth gossip
told her they’d be brown.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That was my late brother-in-law, David Scriabin, at the age
of twenty-five.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani twisted around. Her upper back cramped. She hadn’t even
heard the door open.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He had just been elected First Deputy to Exterior Minister
al-Muhammed.” Anais Ulanova stood in the doorway, eyeing Jani with cool
cordiality. Unlike many public figures, she was just as imposing in private.
Medium height, very thin, she wore a long-sleeved, floor-length black gown of
stark design. Weighty gold hoops hung from her ears. Her short, dark brown hair
glistened in the room’s soft light, its swept-back style accentuating her
aquiline nose and wide-set eyes. Lyssa van Reuter, thirty annealing years on.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Your Excellency,” Jani said, with a shallow bow that was as
much as her balky back and colonial sensibility would allow.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova’s dark gaze shifted to the portrait, and softened.
“He became Minister himself only five years later, the youngest Cabinet member
in Commonwealth history. That was the year my sister and he married.” She waved
languidly toward two nearby chairs set at opposite ends of a long, low table,
on which rested a silver beverage service. “You’d like a refreshment? Coffee,
perhaps?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sat down, her stomach grumbling as the rich aroma of
truebean reached her. “With all due respect, ma’am, if our positions were
reversed, I doubt you’d drink anything I offered.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Be rude if you wish, Ms. Tyi,” Ulanova said as she poured.
“But it is a cold winter’s afternoon, and I need my coffee.” She sat back, cup
and saucer in hand, her posture impeccable. “Lieutenant Pascal will be joining
us shortly.” A smile flirted with the corners of her thin-lipped mouth. “Off
seeing to things he could just as well leave to his staff. He really is the
most . . . thorough young man.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani waited until Ulanova raised her cup to drink. “He’s
fucking Claire, too, you know. He’s snaking you with her just like David
Scriabin did with your sister.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Coffee sloshed, spattering Ulanova’s dress. Fifty years in
the public arena served her well—the pain that flashed across her face
disappeared instantly. “I never would have suspected you a wallower in common
gossip,” she said slowly as she dabbed at her skirt with a linen napkin.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, I understand the situation was rather uncommon, even by
Family standards. You and Scriabin had set the date and picked out the silver,
next thing you know, you’re a sister-in-law.” Jani tilted her head in the
direction of the Scriabin portrait. “The resemblance to Lieutenant Pascal is
startling. Are they related, or do you breed David look-alikes on a farm
somewhere?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If this is the way you intend to play, Ms. Tyi, please be
advised I earned my letter in the sport before you were born.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I intend to disclose fully to Minister van Reuter this
conversation as soon as I return to Interior House, ma’am.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My <i class="calibre4">ex</i>-nephew-in-law is an incompetent drunkard who
has, in the grand tradition of his family, surrounded himself with a staff
comprised of children and counter-jumpers. If you think your informing him of
our meeting will help you in any way, you are doomed to disappointment.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Your concern is duly noted, ma’am. Thank you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why did he bring you to Earth?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“A long-overdue vacation, ma’am.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Lieutenant Pascal believes otherwise. He was quite taken
with you, Ms. Tyi. I can’t recall when anyone impressed him more.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My thanks to the lieutenant for the vote of confidence.”
Jani rubbed her cheek and smothered a yawn. <i class="calibre4">She ordered Lucien to jump me.
She knows I’m augmented, or made a damned good guess. She wanted me post-augie.
She wanted me off my game</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you sure you won’t have coffee, Captain? Or perhaps
you’d prefer something stronger? You appear drawn.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani caught the tip of her tongue between her teeth, then
shook her head. “Captain? I don’t have a rank. I’m not Service.” She forced a
conciliatory smile. “I’ve only just come off a long-haul, ma’am. I don’t
recover from those as quickly as I used to.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Some emotion flared in Ulanova’s eyes, the last flickers of
a dying fire. Then, with a complete lack of fuss, she filled a cup from the
coffee ewer and thrust it at Jani.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
After a pointed pause, Jani accepted the coffee. The cup’s
holopattern caught the light as she drew it near; minuscule iridescent
snowflakes seemed to tumble down the smooth white sides. She took a healthy
swallow of the black, foamy brew. Strong. Sugared. Bracing. Lovely.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova’s measured voice slithered past her strange torpor.
“I can be a powerful ally, Ms. Tyi. The reverse also holds true.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“With all due respect, ma’am, why tell me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Evan brought you here to perform an investigation. All I
ask is that you inform me of your findings as you do him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re asking me to betray my Minister’s confidence, ma’am.
What am I worth if I do that?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ve never been one to begrudge practicality.” Ulanova raised
the lid of one of a trio of small dishes and removed a tiny, multicolored
cakelet. “And coming over to the winning side before the last decisive battle
seems to me the height of practicality.” The stiff icing crunched like frozen
snow as she bit down.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I wasn’t aware we were at war, ma’am.” Jani finished her
coffee down to the bitter, grainy dregs.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Trust me, Ms. Tyi, when I tell you we have a situation
developing of even greater concern than the secessionist threat.” Ulanova
refilled her cup and pushed the cake server toward her side of the table. “Have
you ever heard the name <i class="calibre4">Jani Kilian</i>?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Only a few thousand times</i>. “No, ma’am, it doesn’t
sound familiar.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Knevçet Shèràa?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Poor pronunciation—too much buzz in the “c</i>.” “Is that
an idomeni phrase?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Rikart Neumann?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Everyone’s heard of the Neumanns, ma’am.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Acton van Reuter,” Ulanova said, a shade too loudly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My minister’s late father.” Jani popped a cakelet into her
mouth. “The Old Hawk. Died about four years ago. Age of sixty-seven. David
Scriabin was only sixty-four. NUVA-SCAN patriarchs don’t seem to live very long
these days, do they, ma’am?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova arched a stenciled eyebrow. “Perhaps the word <i class="calibre4">treason</i>
may serve to fix your attention, Ms. Tyi. Treason, and premeditated murder.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani’s jaw stalled in mid-chew. <i class="calibre4">I had my reasons</i>.
“Ma’am?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Before Ulanova could explain further, Lucien entered. He
covered the distance to their table in a few rapid strides. “Your Excellency,”
he said, handing her a sheet of parchment.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
As Ulanova studied the document, her expression grew more
and more somber.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you recall our recent discussion of Commonwealth
kidnapping laws, ma’am?” Lucien asked as he dragged a chair tableside.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Parchment crackled as Ulanova’s grip tightened. “Thank you,
Lieutenant.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We’ve wasted this lady’s time,” Lucien said, gesturing
toward Jani, “and entered tricky legal territory in the process.” He served
himself coffee, then dug into the cakes, popping them into his mouth one after
the other. “Kilian’s dead. No one could have lived through that explosion.” He
had combed his hair and shed the snowgear. He now wore a snug turtleneck the
color of rubies and Service winterweight trousers striped down the side in the
same rich hue.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Mainline stripe</i>. Jani swirled her cup. <i class="calibre4">Mine was
sideline white</i>. She checked his footwear. Sensible boots, like hers, though
in better shape. Black. Mirror-polished and steel-toed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova handed the paper back to Lucien. “The woman’s ID
chip was never found,” she said. “Her death is assumption only.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien staged another assault on the cakes. “Analysis of the
wreckage showed that a pulse bomb had been placed directly over the transport’s
main battery, beneath the front of the passenger compartment.” He glanced at
Jani. “Anyone sitting in the front of the craft was vaporized. The ID chips the
recovery crew did find were as badly damaged as any they’d ever seen. It was
their opinion Kilian’s was obliterated.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova snorted. “That has never happened!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“There’s a first time for everything,” Lucien replied.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Maybe, if I’d been sitting in the front</i>. The memory
of the transport cabin air’s ozone tang burned Jani’s throat. <i class="calibre4">But I was way
in the back</i>. Jammed between the rearmost seat and the bulkhead, wrists
bound to ankles, head between her knees. She could almost feel the rumble of
the directionals shuddering through her dainty salon chair—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Pulse bomb</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ms. Tyi is just what she says she is, an Interior field
agent,” Lucien said. “Kilian’s dead. Murdered along with the rest of the
Twelfth Rovers.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani leaned forward slowly and set her cup on the table.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova grew thoughtful. “Some would maintain Kilian’s death
was an execution. My friend Gisela Detmers-Neumann, for one. You’ve heard of <i class="calibre4">her</i>,
I assume, Ms. Tyi?” Her gaze sharpened as she shouldered on. “But innocent
people died in that explosion, as well. Rescuers and rescued—loyal Spacers all.
A great scandal, one to shake the foundations of the Commonwealth, the trust
between those who administer and those who defend.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">The explosion wasn’t an accident</i>. It had been
planned, by someone who couldn’t allow the events that transpired at Knevçet
Shèràa to become known.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ve been trying to connect Acton van Reuter to that
transport explosion for nine years,” Ulanova said. “He died before justice
could be served directly. But I will accept his son in his stead, Ms. Tyi.
Someone who could bring me proof Evan knew of his father’s guilt and covered it
up would earn the Commonwealth’s gratitude as well as mine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani grooved her right thumbnail into the lifeline of her
numb left palm. <i class="calibre4">She called you a loyal Spacer, Borgie</i>. Rose pink carrier
bled through the abraded synthon, forming a string of tiny, liquid pearls. <i class="calibre4">Isn’t
that nice of her</i>? “I’m sorry, ma’am,” she said as she massaged away the
sticky liquid. “I don’t mean to appear thick, but I don’t understand what you
and Lieutenant Pascal are talking about.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien stared straight ahead. Ulanova regarded Jani for a
long moment, then pushed back the lids of the other two servers. “We also have
fruit tarts and biscotti, Ms. Tyi,” she said. “Unfortunately, the lieutenant
has been greedy enough to eat all the cake.” Her sidelong look at Lucien held
murder. “No surprise there, it seems.” She rose. “We have apparently detained
you unnecessarily. Allow me to extend my most heartfelt apologies. The
lieutenant will see to any compensation you feel is merited.” She swept out of
the room in a swirl of black.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stared after the departed minister, her stomach
gurgling its own farewell. Then the sound of muffled laughter claimed her
attention. She turned to the chuckling Lucien.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He gave her a thumbs-up. “Good job,” he offered around a
mouthful of fruit tart. “The quieter she gets, the madder she is.” His
shoulders shook. “She’s really pissed!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You can both—” Jani stopped as her stomach gurgled again,
this time more urgently. Cramps rippled through her abdomen. Cold sweat bloomed
and beaded. “Where’s—” She clamped a hand over her mouth as the saliva flooded.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh shit!” Lucien grabbed her by the shoulders and herded
her toward the door. “Not on the rugs—not on the rugs!” He pushed her out into
the hall. “Second door on the right!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stumbled into the bathroom, reaching the sink just in
time. She kept her eyes closed as she vomited. She groped for the faucet and
cranked it open, washing away the rancid stench, replacing it with the clean
smell of flowing water.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Heavy footsteps closed in from behind. “Are you all right?”
Jani jerked as an icy lump touched the back of her neck. “Steady on—it’s just a
coldpack.” As the chill soaked through her shirt, her knees gave way. She
sagged to the tiled floor, Lucien providing just enough support to keep her
from cracking her head against the plumbing. Her emptied stomach gave a last
trembling lurch. She moaned and rested her cheek on the cold floor.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you need a doctor?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani opened one eye. <i class="calibre4">What is it about me and men and
bathrooms</i>? Lucien sat atop the marble vanity, legs swinging from the knee.
Back—forth—back—forth. The motion nauseated her anew. “No.” She closed her eye
and tried to feel whether her filming had fissured. “What the hell was it, and
where?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Silence. A sigh. “Ascertane. Glazed inside your coffee cup.”
The sound of a fastener being worked, a bottle seal being cracked. “I don’t
understand your reaction. Ascertane’s a mild anti-inhibitory—you’re not
supposed to know you’ve been drugged. You’re just supposed to feel happy.
Trusting.” The slide of cloth against counter. Footsteps. “Here. Drink this.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani opened both eyes. Lucien and his identical twin slowly
merged into a single, blurry-edged figure holding a small dispo filled with
yellow liquid. “Stick it in your ear.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s for nausea.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I already have that. Thank you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Look.” Lucien gulped the tiny draft. “Same bottle. Same
damned cup!” He refilled the dispo, swallowed that as well, refilled it again,
then placed it on the floor in front of Jani. “Suit yourself,” he said as he
returned to his perch. “I’m just trying to help.” He shoved the bottle into a
Service-issue toiletry kit and yanked the fastener closed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah, you’re a real humanitarian.” Jani worked into a
sitting position, pausing every so often to give her stomach time to catch up.
Then she picked up the tiny cup and sniffed the bright yellow syrup. The harsh
lemon odor made her cough.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien glared at her. “It’s the same stuff we drank by the
barrel during flight training.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I didn’t have flight training, did I?” Jani drained the
dispo, gagging as the thick liquid burned her throat.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t understand.” Lucien linked his hands around his
knee. “I’ve administered Ascertane a hundred times—all it does is make you
blab.” He rocked back. “That nausea stuff works fast. Feel better?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani swallowed. Her stomach remained steady. “I think so.”
She rested her head against the wall and watched Lucien watch her. “I told her
about Claire. Just to see her reaction.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
His rocking continued without a hitch. “Which was?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Surprise. I think I actually caught her unawares.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So she’ll send Claire away. Won’t be the first time she’s
sent someone away.” His eyes slitted as he smirked, slanting upward at the
corners. “Or the last.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani compared Lucien’s face to David Scriabin’s. His was
longer, his cheekbones not as high. Close enough in the dark, though. “You
know, David Scriabin and Anais Ulanova were quite the item until he lost his
nerve and eloped with her younger, prettier, less ambitious sister. He and
Anais never quite called it quits, however. A typical Family mess.” She sat up
straighter. The antinausea brew had functioned as promised. “So, you aren’t her
first twenty-five-year-old tow-head.” She tossed the coldpack back to Lucien.
“Or her last.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien caught the pack with one hand. Without a word, he
slid off the vanity, placed the toiletry kit on the rim of the sink, and left.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani took a few “get-ready” breaths and eased to her feet,
using the wall as a support. She rummaged through the kit, liberating a
single-use toothbrush and a pouch of oral rinse. “The man’s a born looker-after
of old ladies.” Jani removed the wrapper from the toothbrush. “Of course, if
you took him home to meet mother, she’d fight you for him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien was waiting for Jani in the hall, her jacket in hand.
Instead of his Service winter camou, he had opted for the standard-issue
snowsuit in an alarming shade of bright blue. The glaring color made him look
like an overgrown little boy.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Except around the eyes</i>. Jani looked into the familiar
chilly brown stare. She allowed him to help her with her jacket, then followed
him silently. Just before leaving the house, she turned. The kittenish Claire
watched them from the end of the hall, arms folded, face in the shadows.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Neither Jani nor Lucien donned their facegear before going
outside. Instead, in psychic agreement, they made a bare-headed dash for the
waiting skimmer, piling into seats and pulling shut gullwings, causing the
vehicle to rock as though wind-buffeted. Jani’s backache had lessened to
stiffness; the short exposure to the frigid air slapped away the last of her
sick haze. By the time Lucien ramped onto the Boul, she felt human again.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Near death makes you appreciate the simple things</i>.
She studied the Chicago skyline with heightened interest. <i class="calibre4">Near murder gives
them that extra glow</i>. She savored the buildings of new stone and old glass,
their angled, diamond-shaped summits and swirling scrollery. This time around,
she even took note of the Greatest War Memorial, its molecular clock coating
glowing crimson in the stark winter sun. “Did it take you two long to
rehearse?” she asked as the capital zipped by. “My questioning.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It wasn’t my idea.” Lucien eased behind a ponderous
people-mover and backed off the accelerator. Their zip slowed to an easy glide.
“She flipped as soon as she discovered van Reuter had gone to Whalen himself to
collect you. That nailed it. As far as she was concerned, you were Jani
Kilian.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But you didn’t think so?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“On the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>?” Lucien shrugged. “You acted like
someone with something to hide. But then, don’t we all?” He bypassed the ramp
that would have returned them to the Interior access skimway. “Besides, I
scanned you in this skimmer—it’s off now—and compared the reading to the ID
we’d lifted from Kilian’s Service record. She had it all planned.
Confrontation, forced confession, deal. But the scans didn’t match, and she
couldn’t proceed without paper proof.” He slowed the skimmer further, until
other vehicles actually began passing them. “Aren’t you even a little curious
why this Kilian is so important?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani watched a distant shuttle descend like a pulse-powered
beetle. <i class="calibre4">Means to an end. Ulanova wants Evan’s head on any platter she can
find</i>. “I don’t even know when all this was supposed to have happened.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Eighteen years ago—the last idomeni civil war.” Lucien
snatched glances at her as he maneuvered off the Boul and into a crowded
commercial district. “Laumrau versus Vynshà, winner take all. The Laumrau were
winning until this thing with Kilian happened. All sorts of mess bubbled to the
surface after she died. Some Family members, led by Rikart Neumann and Acton
van Reuter, had apparently agreed to throw their support behind the Laum in
exchange for augmentation technology.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">It’s for the home world, Kilian. Who cares about a few
xenogeologists from a colonial consortium no one’s ever fucking heard of</i>!
Neumann had stood nose to nose with her. His breath, scented from ever-present
throat lozenges, had wafted around her in cinnamon-tinged puffs. <i class="calibre4">Work with
me now, you come to Earth with me when it’s over. Cross me, and I’ll snap your
spine</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Problem was, the idomeni had never had another race
involved in their wars before. Everything had always been very ordered, in as
much as a war can be ordered. Organized. Very . . . well,
idomeni.” Lucien steered into an underground lot and edged the skimmer into a
narrow charge station. “The fact that the Laum had actually courted disorder by
dealing with humans staggered all the idomeni. The Vynshà had been getting
ripped up to that point, but they were able to publicize what happened and turn
it to their advantage. They took the dominant capital of Rauta Shèràa less than
four months later.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani followed Lucien out of the garage and onto a moving
sidewalk. Pushed along by a swelling crowd, they entered a glass-enclosed mall
with a large skating rink in its center.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien tugged on her sleeve. “Do you feel up to anything?”
He flashed a dark red plastic card that proved, at second glance, to be an
Exterior Ministry expense voucher. “It’s on her.” They wandered over to a snack
kiosk that, if the posted prices were any indication, did most of its business
with Cabinet expense accounts.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
In deference to her iffy stomach, Jani opted for an iced
fruit drink. Lucien protested he had an image to maintain with Exterior
Contractor Accounts and ordered enough overpriced food to feed them both for
the day. They carried laden trays to a rinkside table, doffed their coats, and
settled in. Jani’s drink turned out to be grapefruit-flavored. Very tart; it
stripped the last of the minty oral rinse from her tongue.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Then the assorted aromas from Lucien’s side of the table
reached her. Fried onion. Grilled beef. Melted butter. “What kind of technology
did Neumann and van Reuter get from the Laum?” Jani asked as she tipped back
her chair and started breathing through her mouth.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hints on how to upgrade augmentation technology, in a way
that could be better adapted to personality alteration.” Lucien dug into his
food like a starved teenager. “I don’t think it ever worked out, though.
Idomeni brain chemistry is different from ours, and they’ve got that culture of
theirs as an external force to keep their antisocial personalities in line. The
humans they tried the augie upgrade on flipped. Twelve sheets to the wind. The
research petered out years ago.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But not before Acton sacrificed his firstborn grandson on
the R and D altar</i>. Jani crunched ice. “Who did they test the new augie on?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Volunteers, I assume. Research subject stipends can be
pretty substantial.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">So you don’t know everything</i>. Some secrets still lay
buried beneath the sands of Knevçet Shèràa. “And what does Kilian have to do
with all this?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien dredged a forkful of fried potatoes through a dollop
of mayonnaise. Jani looked away while he chewed. “She was a sideline captain,”
he said. “Documents examiner. Academy grad, of all things. Reported to
Neumann.” His tone grew thoughtful. “Anais thinks some kind of double cross
occurred. Either they argued over division of the spoils, or Neumann tried to
push Kilian out of the deal altogether. All she’s certain of is that Kilian
murdered Neumann, along with a few Laum who got in the way. What no one
realized was, Acton was keeping tabs. He knew he faced prison if any details of
his collusion with the Laum got out, so he arranged for the elimination of the
one person who could put him there.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But I didn’t know</i>. Neither had any of her real
soldiers. Jani took tiny sips of her drink, applying it like salve to her
tender stomach. <i class="calibre4">By the way, Ev, you know my little investigation—your daddy
is involved. Do you want me to stop now</i>? Dull pain radiated across her
abdomen. She set her glass down with a clatter.
</p>

Lucien flinched. “What’s the matter?” He tried to smile.
“Aren’t you having fun? I am.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You have an odd idea of fun, Lieutenant.” Jani turned her
attention toward the rink skaters. Most were average at best, but one pair
struck her as particularly good. “So, you and Anais are pretty close?” she
asked, as the man flipped his partner into the air.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien donned the look of innocence he’d employed to
perfection on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>. “Look, I’m sorry if that bothers you, but
it’s none of your—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She ever bring work home?” Jani joined other shoppers in
applause as the partner landed cleanly on one edge and spun immediately into a
quad-triple combination. The attention she paid to the skating display seemed
to bother Lucien. He tapped his fork against the rim of his plate, remaining
silent until she looked at him.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sometimes,” he said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She chairs the Cabinet Court Board of Inquiry?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Uh-huh.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Think you could get me a copy of the Court Summary of
Investigation of Evan van Reuter?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Because Acton van Reuter tried to kill me to prevent his
dealings in illegal idomeni technology from being known. He used that
technology on his grandson. His grandson died</i>. Then Lyssa had herself
augmented. How much more deeply had she explored what happened to Martin, and
why? Who had she spooked? <i class="calibre4">This didn’t die with Acton van Reuter</i>. Which
meant someone else was involved in what had happened at Knevçet Shèràa.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
And that someone had murdered Lyssa.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Because,” Jani replied, “the Court Summary contains the
documents references for all the evidence examined. Once you have a doc
reference, you can track it down in systems.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You can’t do that without Court-level passwor—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s why you’re going to supply me with those, too.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien segued from innocence to indignation. “I’m an
Intelligence officer in the mainline Service. I signed the Commonwealth Secrets
Act.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Despite those obvious shortcomings, I still think you
capable of carrying out simple theft.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s illeg—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So is kidnapping, as you were so kind to point out. But you
don’t see me belaboring the point. Not yet, anyway.” <i class="calibre4">Acton van Reuter tried
to murder me</i>. And slaughtered her real soldiers in the process. <i class="calibre4">Who else
knew the story</i>? Who had Lyssa flushed from the undergrowth before she went
on that final bender?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The Summary hasn’t been issued yet. It’s still in draft, no
final Court seal. Not as grave a sin.” Suddenly, Lucien grinned. If you ignored
his eyes, you’d think it was your lucky day. “If I get it for you, what do I
get in exchange?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The Commonwealth’s gratitude.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not yours?” He cupped his chin in his hand and leered
politely.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani reached across the table and brushed a finger along his
arm. “Considering your penchant for gadgets, do you by any chance have
something that could secure a workstation?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m sure someone at your level in Interior would have
secured—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I want to make sure.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien’s smile tightened. “Will you please stop interrupting
me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It needs to be a portable jig, something I can move from
machine to machine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t take orders from you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, but you’ll do it, if for no other reason than that
someday you’ll be able to tell Anais all about it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Dead eyes widened. To call the look “surprised” would have
been overstating the case. But awareness would do, appreciation that she knew
Lucien better than he thought, that he didn’t fool all the people all the time.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll see what I can do,” he said after a while. “Will there
be anything else, General?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, I think that should do it for now.” Jani finished her
drink. “Thanks for the snack. I’ll be in touch.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where are you going?” Lucien scrambled for his coat. “I
thought we’d spend the afternoon together.” Judging from his flustered
behavior, rejection was an unfamiliar experience. “Like we did on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>,
remember?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I have things to do.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How will I contact you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not directly. I’ll send a runner for the paper and the jig.
I don’t think we should be seen together anymore.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Just squeeze me dry and cast me aside, huh?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You got it.” Jani patted his cheek in farewell. Then she
darted into the midst of the milling shoppers. She heard Lucien call, “Damn it,
Risa!” but she didn’t look back, and she didn’t slow down. She knew how to lose
herself in a crowd.
