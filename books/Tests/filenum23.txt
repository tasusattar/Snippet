<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani ignored a staffer’s efforts to announce her arrival
and brushed past him into the Private House dining room. Evan, who had been
sitting with his back to the door, stood up unsteadily as she cut across the
room to the portable bar.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jesus, you do bang around, don’t you?” He smiled
tentatively, swirling the contents of his glass. “There was no need for you to
rush. First chance I’ve had to be by myself all day. Gave me a chance to catch
my breath.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani poured herself a glass of water and watched Evan sample
his drink. She had always known him as a steady drinker. The official term was <i class="calibre4">maintenance
alcoholic</i>, according to the Court of Inquiry report. He was on a regimen of
alcohol dehydrogenase boosters and nutritional supplements and had a
replacement liver waiting for him in Neoclona-Chicago’s organ storage bank.
Every year, he had a battery of tests to monitor for signs of incipient
alcoholic psychoses. He was on record as saying he had no intention of curbing
his drinking. He would do as he pleased; it was up to his cadre of highly paid
physicians to keep him functional.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He looked Jani up and down. His grin dimmed. “I thought
you’d dress like you did on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>. I was looking forward to it.”
He had certainly gone the full formal route. Black evening suit. Gleaming white
shirt with onyx fasteners. The only thing missing was the red rose in his
crossover lapel.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t give a damn what happened to Lyssa. For the last
two years of her life, you and she barely spoke.” Jani walked over to a serving
cart. Too much time had passed since her last meal. Her stomach ached as though
she’d been punched. “You found out the Court had initiated an investigation of
your father’s conduct during the idomeni civil war. The van Reuter reputation was
at stake. You needed someone with experience in Rauta Shèràa paper to do a
minesweep, help you bury incriminating Service documents Acton recoded as
private paper. Enter yours truly.” She snagged a warm roll from one of the
baskets and bit into it. “You thought I’d help you cover for him to save my
ass. Need I remind you that your Uncle Rik made the same mistake?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Who have you been talking to?” Evan shrugged off Jani’s
answering glare. “Anais has tried to engineer my father’s ruin many times.
She’s always come out looking the fool.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My transport crash was no crash at all. Anais has proof
Acton arranged to have a bomb placed on board. He was involved with Neumann in
the illegal acquisition of augmentation technology from the Laum at Knevçet
Shèràa. They tried to pull me into the mix. I said no. When Rikart pushed, I
pushed back harder.” Jani closed her eyes. She could smell it again, the
singed-leather stink of shooter gloves. “Acton pushed back hardest of all.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Wishful thinking on Anais’s part.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I was there, Evan, remember?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My father was many things. But he believed in Lady
Commonwealth. He would never have slaughtered her soldiers.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Knowing what happened to Martin, how can you stand there
and say that to me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Knowing what happened to Martin gives me every right. The
van Reuter men were always ripe for sacrifice, Jan. That’s our job—it’s an
honor reserved for us alone. Dad would never have deigned to share the glory.”
He walked to the bar and refilled his glass. Four fingers of bourbon—no water
or ice. “I’m not denying what happened to you. I certainly can’t deny Rikart’s
involvement. But nothing my father did is anyone’s concern but mine. He did not
become aware of the Laum technology until after the war. Martin paid the first
installment on that bargain. Serena and Jerrold paid the second, Lyssa, the
third. I’m responsible for the balance, to be repaid in my own currency.” He
took a large swallow. “Anais has come up empty with this search of hers for
years. Now, all of a sudden, she thinks she’s gotten lucky.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani perched on the edge of a dining-room chair. Took a bite
of bread. A gulp of water. She’d eaten this way too many times. Mechanical,
tasteless refueling, choked down just prior to getting the hell out of town.
“Yes, but this time she had Lyssa acting as Interior mole. Your wife had good
reason to hate Acton. She wanted the entire Commonwealth to know what he’d done
to Martin.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It never occurred to her that she could damage her own
reputation in the process. People would ask how she could have allowed it to
happen. I tried to explain that to her, but she wouldn’t listen to reason. I’m
a magnet for women who refuse to listen to reason.” Evan walked slowly toward
Jani, stopping when he came within arm’s reach. “Durian told me about your
forced excursion this afternoon. Don’t you see what Anais is trying to do?
She’s trying to drive a wedge between us, convince you it’s safe to throw in
with her.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She may have a point.” Jani brushed crumbs from her
fingers. The bread rested like ballast in her stomach. “The Court will be
releasing its findings one week from today. The final summation contains a
demand for your resignation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How do you know that?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I read the report.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A host of emotions played across Evan’s face as Jani’s words
sank in. Surprise. Elation. Anger. Fear. “Aren’t you the enterprising one,” he
finally said, his words strung out like beads on a wire. “How did you manage to
obtain it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Never mind.” Jani picked out another roll. “Besides, I
don’t have it anymore.” Technically, that was true. She had stashed it in the
women’s locker room next to Interior’s main gymnasium. “You don’t sound
surprised.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I had my own artfully acquired copy delivered into my hands
earlier today. Neatest piece of fiction I’ve read in years. I noted several
gaps in the evidence. They seemed to coincide with every point the Court needs
to make its case.” Evan sighted Jani with the cobalt stare that had swayed
voters for two decades. “Did Anais provide you with your copy of the report, by
any chance?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why would she do that?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She’ll use you, Jan. She’ll take what she can, then lock
you up and throw away the code.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And you’re offering me so much more, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I can offer you anything you want.” He sat in the chair
next to hers, still taking care to keep his distance, not to allow anything he
did to seem threatening. “I never stopped caring for you. I never stopped
wishing things had worked out differently. My life with you in Rauta Shèràa was
the best time of my life. I want that life back.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Evan, don’t lie to me. You brought me here to salvage that
old bastard’s reputation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I brought you here to take care of you!” His fingers
tightened around his glass, the knuckles whitening. “To make it up to you, for
everything you went through. I had a house in the city picked out for you. A
job, if you wanted to work. I had it all planned.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t need anyone to take care of me. I can take care of
myself.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ve seen your idea of taking care of yourself. I’ve seen
what it’s done to you. Leave the thinking to someone else.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But thought is all I have</i>. Planning. Outwitting. The
art of seeming to give in when actually giving nothing. She’d read her Service
file in the library carrel, through shrewder, more discerning eyes. <i class="calibre4">I’m what
I’ve always been, only more so</i>. “I don’t like to be beholden, Evan. I
prefer to pay my own way.” Jani stared at him until the arrogant gleam in his
eyes degraded to uncertainty. “In my own currency.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan sank back in his chair. The skin on his face was
greyed, the hollows beneath his eyes, deepened. “Has Anais identified you? Does
she know you’re Jani Kilian?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. She had me scanned. The current pattern doesn’t match
my Service ID.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well then, what can she do to you? How can she threaten
you? Don’t let her scare you—she has nothing!” He touched her at last, resting
his hand on her knee. “Just keep your mouth shut and wait her out. Follow my
lead—I’ve brazened my way through more than one full frontal assault in my
time.” Taking her silence for agreement, he pressed a touchpad alongside his
place setting. Uniformed staffers entered by way of a narrow access door and
began serving the first course.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So what did you do today?” he asked when they were again
alone. “Besides getting yourself kidnapped and purloining top secret Cabinet
documents.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Just mucked about.” Jani fished a mushroom slice out of her
soup. Fungi, she had learned over the past few months, were <i class="calibre4">not</i> an
option. “Visited the Library.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You seem to have made some interesting friends.” Evan
filled his wineglass to the brim. “Durian told me you’ve been seen with Steven
Forell. Durian has a great deal to say about Mr. Forell, none of it
complimentary.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Durian wants to wrap his slimy paws around Angevin Wyle. He
blames Steve for keeping that from happening. If he knew how Angevin really
felt about him, he’d spin in his well-appointed seat for a week.” Jani ate what
she could of the soup, then tested the green salad. When she looked up, she
found Evan studying her, chin cradled in hand. “What?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How long have you been here?” he asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">He’s so close. He wants me to reach out and touch</i>—Jani
felt the heat rise in her face; she looked down at her plate. “Little over a
day.” The salad contained chopped apple. She reached for the pepper mill
instead.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So much news acquired in a little over a day. Tell me, are
there any other love affairs affecting members of my executive staff that you
think I should know about?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani regarded the mill in her hand. It had a decidedly
suggestive shape. “Well, the head of your Farms Bureau used to holo himself
screwing assorted animal life in his office. He’s not doing it anymore, though.
AgMin shut him down.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan’s eyes widened. He sat back and clamped a hand over his
mouth.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I hope we’re not having lamb or chicken tonight,” she added
peevishly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
His shoulders shook. Gently, at first, then more and more
violently. He’d always been a remarkably quiet laugher. He’d turn red and choke
before he’d make a sound.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani continued eating. After a minute or so, she reached
over and thumped Evan between his shoulder blades. He inhaled with a wheezing
gasp.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t remember—the last time—oh shit, Jan, don’t ever do
that to me again.” He wiped his tearing eyes with his napkin, then sat quietly,
his hands over his face. “I remember the night—they threw us out—of the
Consulate bar—oh hell.” He started up again, though much more weakly. “You’ll
stay here, won’t you?” he asked when he’d finally summoned the strength to talk
in complete sentences. “If they can’t ID you, why leave?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani examined the spice dispenser. Something called <i class="calibre4">ground
habañero</i> had a lightning bolt beside the name. She sprinkled it liberally
on her salad. “What if you’re forced to resign?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then I’ll resign. Move back to the house in the Bluffs,
play the gentleman of leisure. Answer my question, Jan.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Gentleman of leisure. You’ll go crazy.” She coughed. The
habañero wasn’t bad.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I won’t go crazy if I know you’re nearby. I’d sleep easier
tonight if I knew I could count on you. Can I?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why would you think you couldn’t?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan pressed a hand to his temple. “You’re deflecting me.
One eye on the exit, just like always. I could afford your evasions in Rauta
Shèràa. I can’t afford them now. Can I count on your support or not?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Always the pressure to give and give . . .
in exchange for what</i>? She wasn’t the only one who hadn’t changed with time.
“Blind loyalty’s a quality I can’t afford, Evan. Tell me what to expect.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“These situations tend to follow a pattern. No one will
officially acknowledge my existence for about six months, although my real
friends will send notes and such, just to make sure I’m keeping body and soul
together. Then I’ll start getting visits. Old allies asking for advice. Old
adversaries checking my pulse. Within a year to eighteen months, I’ll be ready
to make a run at a deputy Cabinet seat. Next thing you know, it’ll be like I
never left.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sounds formulaic.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It happened to Dad. It’s happened to me before.” Evan
stirred his soup, which he’d barely touched. “It’s just politics.” He watched
her eat, his brow wrinkling. “You used to tell me how spicy your mother’s
cooking was.” He pointed to her salad plate. “I never thought that was what you
meant. Lacks subtlety, at least from where I’m sitting. What’s going on?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked down at her salad. “I don’t know what you mean.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The chef aboard the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> had some interesting
things to say concerning your culinary requests.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You had crew reporting on me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. Durian did.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Durian did?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll admit he may not have had the purest motives, but when
I spoke with him a few hours ago, he seemed genuinely concerned.” Evan propped
his elbows on the table and tented his hands. “He suggested I ask you a few
questions. For example, are you drinking a lot of water—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani set down her refilled glass. The third. No, the fourth—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—and are foods that you’d once been able to eat with no
reaction making you sick now?” Evan jerked his chin in the direction of Jani’s
salad. “Have your tastes changed, become what most of us might consider odd?
Have you been experiencing body aches, abdominal distress—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You sound like John Shroud.” Jani tried to laugh.
“Interrogations every third day, same hour of the morning, same crummy therapy
room.” If she closed her eyes, she could visualize the bare, dark tan walls,
the restraint-bedecked myostimulator squatting in one corner like the hulking
torture device it was.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan disrupted her grim vision. “Jani, one colonist has
recently died from a condition which began with the symptoms I described. The
symptoms you’re evidencing. I wish you’d see a doctor.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani examined her hands. Her right one shook a bit, but that
was only because she was angry. <i class="calibre4">The garage guy’s stomach always hurt</i>.
Well, hers did, too. <i class="calibre4">He threw up a lot</i>. Ok. <i class="calibre4">He tried to kill his
grandmother with a lazor</i>. Except his grandmother had been dead for twenty
years; he exhausted himself annihilating a pillow. Hepatic dementia, the
doctors had called it. They had a name for everything.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I have never tried to kill any dead female relatives</i>.
Hah—had them there. Besides, everyone in NorthPort knew the garage guy became
sick from eating Haárin food. Lots of people on Whalen tried Haárin foodstuffs
at least once. Jani had been eating it for years—it wasn’t her problem. She
attacked her water again. “Well, I wish you’d do something about your
drinking,” she said as she came up for air. “We can’t have everything, can we?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
On cosmic cue, two staffers entered. They cleared and carved
silently, but with many covert glances toward the table.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Here’s a deal for you,” Evan said after they left. “I’ll
face my little problem when you face yours.” He cut into his roast beef. A
smile flickered. “Not lamb or chicken,” he said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m not sick.” Jani drove the point home by adding habañero
to her meat as well. “I’m sorry if my colonial taste offends your Earthbound
sensibilities, but don’t compound your prejudice by calling it a disease.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Have it your own way, Jan,” Evan replied. “For now.” They
finished eating in silence, then adjourned to the adjacent sitting room for
dessert and coffee. He carried his cup to the bar and, with a pointed look at
Jani, added a generous splash of brandy. “Do you want to talk about Lyssa? I’m
sure, since you read the report, you have questions.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani swallowed a belch. It felt as though a hot coal had
lodged beneath her sternum. “I had already guessed she was augmented. The Court
report research confirmed it. I think she had it done in order to feel what
Martin had gone through. But she didn’t have the right brain chemistry to
withstand the stress. It was all pretty easy to figure, if you knew what to
look for.” She explained about the gossip magazine’s crisis timeline. “Someone
saw their chance and took advantage. It didn’t take much to make her death look
like an accident.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan leaned against the bar. “You’d think it would have
helped her, don’t you?” he said, his voice dead. “The Service uses it to build
better soldiers—you’d think it would’ve helped her cope.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Lyssa should never have been augied. Her mental state was
already precarious, and it only got worse. Even frequent take-downs weren’t
leveling her out—she was headed for augie psychosis. If she’d been Service,
she’d never have made it past the initials. She’d have been typed as a likely
burnout and kicked out of the program.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan smiled grimly. “Augie burnout. I used to hear that
phrase in meetings.” He looked at Jani. “Burnouts hallucinate to a greater
degree than regular augies. Borderlines, too. Like you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Depends what you mean by hallucinate. My problems are with
smell, mostly. I catch a noseful of berries whenever I get aggravated. Never
heard voices, thank God. Never saw spiders crawling out of the walls.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan approached her with the slow step and unfocused eye of
a man on the way to his own execution. As he lowered himself into the chair
next to her, he exuded the same beaten-down wariness she had felt toward the
myostimulator. <i class="calibre4">This needs to be worked through. This needs to be done. But
that doesn’t mean we have to like it</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“A year after the children died, I visited Lyssa’s suite
without calling first. We had reached the point where we called first. She was
sitting alone on her bed. She looked so happy—I thought she’d drugged herself.
Being a doctor, she had access to the staff infirmary.” His spiked coffee
rested on his knee, its surface rippling.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She was talking. To them. She saw me eventually, or at
least <i class="calibre4">sensed</i> me. Didn’t Martin look nice in his school uniform, she
asked? He’d just told her he wanted to be a doctor like his mum. I slipped out
as quickly as I could.” He hoisted his cup. “My drinking, to that point, hadn’t
been too bad, but it did pick up from then on.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sipped her coffee. “You didn’t know?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“About the augment?” He shook his head. “Not until I read
the report today. Like I said, I thought she’d been drugging.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’d been exposed to it so much in your day-to-day, I’m
surprised nothing clicked.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan leaned back in his chair. “I blocked it out, I guess.
Didn’t feel I had the right to inquire. I figured by that time, Lyssa and I
were each entitled to the pit of our choosing. I didn’t even ok an
autopsy—that’s what set Cao on the warpath. But I felt she deserved that . . .
privacy. A last kind gesture from me, to make up for all the others.” He looked
at Jani, his eyes reflecting the depths of his own abyss. “This may sound
horrible, but I think whoever killed her did her a favor. Every once in a
while, I wish they’d show me the same consideration.” He refilled his cup from
the ewer.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shifted in her chair. She was angry. Her back ached.
Her stomach had begun to rumble ominously. She didn’t think she could deal with
a drunken Evan as well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t worry,” he said, reading her mind. “Just coffee,
until you leave. I promise.” He shook a finger at her. “But I must insist you
allow me my pit. I’ve earned it. These past few months, it’s become a second
home.” He gestured toward the curtained wall opposite them. “Here’s something
you might like.” He pressed a touchpad near the tray. The drapes swept aside.
“Isn’t it pretty?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A spun-sugar world filled the window. Lit by rainbow lights,
with the night as a backdrop, two banked tiers of snow-frosted hybrid shrubs
glittered. Some of the dwarf evergreens had been clipped into spires and coils,
while others had been shaped into stylized buildings. In the center, a line of
graceful, needled shrubs had been trimmed into a suspension bridge, joining the
two tiers. “It’s pretty,” Jani said, but all it looked was cold. She rubbed her
aching gut and shivered. She didn’t feel very art-appreciative just then.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan picked through the dessert tray. “I had it made for
Nema; we were supposed to have a reception in the main ballroom after his
welcoming ceremony. A bridge for the chief bridge-builder. Obvious, perhaps,
but I felt it appropriate.” He chewed reflectively. “Cao and Ulanova blocked
me, of course. They felt he’d be insulted. As if they’d fucking know. So I had
it moved here. Next time those two come for dinner, if there ever is a next
time, it’ll be waiting. Hell, if the weather’s good, maybe I’ll have the tables
set up under the damned bridge.” He touched her arm to get her attention.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How did you manage? After the children . . .
I almost cashed in. How did you keep going?” His hand lingered. It was Jani’s
left arm. All she felt was the pressure. “What went through your mind? After
Knevçet Shèràa. During your recovery. When, you knew you’d lost it all. How did
you live?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani pressed down on her aching stomach. “I told myself—”
She stalled. That was the point, wasn’t it? She’d told <i class="calibre4">herself</i>, never
anyone else. “I told myself that I was the last one. If I died, there wouldn’t
be anyone left to remember Knevçet Shèràa.” This time she pronounced it
properly, adding the right-handed gesture that mimicked the sweep of the sand
dunes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan’s hand tightened on her arm. “You’re remembered, Jan,
if it’s any consolation. I’ve seen the files. They fill a two-meter-long shelf
in the Judge Advocate’s office.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s not the remembrance I mean.” Jani grew still; even
her stomach quieted. “I remember the heat. The blowing sand. The sense of dread
when I walked into Eva Yatni’s room.” She had been the first patient to die.
She’d plucked out her eyes and plunged her thumbs into her brain. Neumann
called it suicide.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I remember another patient named Simyan Baru. I watched him
peel the skin from his cheek like it was a piece of fruit. I couldn’t get in
the room to stop him—it was locked. So I went to see Neumann to get the code.
He wouldn’t give it to me. We had a talk. You know what happened next.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I remember when Baru and two other patients escaped. We
tried to treat them as best we could, but they were too far gone.
Hallucinating. They thought we were Laum, come to kill them. They jumped
Felicio and Stanleigh and stole our people mover. The only transport we had. We
had nothing to knock it down with, no way to repair it if we did. I watched it
disappear over the rise. I saw the flash after the Laum chased it down.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I remember the whine of the shatterboxes. My corporal’s
death. The last night, ordering Sergeant Burgoyne to take everyone into the
basement. I said it was because of the threat of further bombing, but I looked
at him and he looked at me and I <i class="calibre4">needed</i> that look he gave me.” That last
flame lick of hope, driving her forward.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani?” Evan’s voice rasped. “You don’t have to tell me this
if you don’t want.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">What does want have to do with it</i>? “I left them
behind, and I went outside. I checked my shooter. I said a prayer. <i class="calibre4">à Yestha
raùn</i>. Preserve my soul. I cut my left arm from wrist to elbow, sopped up
the blood with a rag, staked the rag near the front door of the hospital. <i class="calibre4">Chäusen
tha sè rau</i>. Shelter my soul—keep it safe.” The stiff red braid rested in
her duffel now—somehow, it had found its way onto the transport, surviving both
the explosion and the crash. John Shroud had recovered it from the wreckage and
returned it to her. “It was so still. So quiet. I knew Knevçet Shèràa was
important to the Laumrau. They needed to take it back from us, reclaim it from
humanish contamination. That meant it was a Night of Conjunction—sacrament and
prayer before a decisive battle. Even the guards were sequestered in their
tents. I remember the silence as I walked over the rise and into their camp.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I remember . . . twenty-six expressions of
surprise on twenty-six faces when I entered twenty-six tents and fired my
shooter twenty-six times.” Shredded the Bilateral Accord and every tenet of
idomeni behavior. Slaughtered them one by one in a way no fellow idomeni had
ever dared. She remembered how the shooter grip overheated and cooked the palm
of her hand. <i class="calibre4">I became one with my weapon that night</i>. A real soldier.
“But most of all, I remember, I <i class="calibre4">have</i> to remember, why. Because it loses
something when you write it down.” She had to remember the fear she’d seen in
her real soldiers’ eyes as Borgie herded them down the stairs. Remember that
only she possessed the knowledge that would guarantee they’d remain alive to
walk back up. “I have to remember, because everyone else seems to want to
forget.”

She turned to find Evan hunched forward, his face buried in
his hands. “Trust me when I tell you, Jan,” he said, his voice muffled, “they
can’t.” He rose and straightlined for the bar. “About that promise I made—I
take it back.” He filled a water glass halfway with bourbon, looked at her, and
poured a second. “I never thought I’d say this to anyone,” he said as he
pressed the glass into her hands, “but you look like you need this more than I
do.”
</p>

Jani swirled the dark caramel liquid. Her films absorbed the
ethanol vapors, stinging her eyes. The tears spilled. She tipped back the glass
and drank. The bourbon burned down her throat. Desert heat.
</p>

“Attagirl.” Evan raised his glass in a toast, then followed
suit. He drank more than she did, and it seemed to have no effect whatsoever on
his eyes. “What do you think would happen,” he asked over the top of his glass,
“if they found out you were you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani took another swallow. A sip, really. Her mouth had gone
numb. “Court-martial. Execution, probably, unless the idomeni pushed for
extradition. They’d probably want to kill me, too. Hell, the line forms in the
rear—if they got inventive, they could have a Neoclona team standing by to
revive me after every barrage. They could keep it going for years.” Poor
John—he’d probably offer to fire the first shot. She smiled bleakly. The
expression froze as her stomach cramped.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I won’t let that happen.” Evan reached out to stroke her
arm. Then he pointed to the glazed garden. “Don’t you wish you could just press
a pad and make everything else disappear. The past. Whatever’s outside the
door. Just the two of us, and to hell with everyone else.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tried to nod, but the movement started a trail of heat
burning up from her stomach. She dropped her glass and bounded out of her
chair, leaving Evan behind to stagger to his feet and call after her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She made it to her bathroom. Barely. Her body let her know
bourbon was never, <i class="calibre4">ever</i>, to be considered an option again. <i class="calibre4">Let us
sing a song of real soldiers . . . first verse</i>. She slumped
against the toilet as the room spun. <i class="calibre4">All dead, so you’re stuck with me</i>.
Then she lost what balance she had. Her skull impacted tile with a vibrating <i class="calibre4">crack</i>.
