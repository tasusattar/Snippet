<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_47">Chapter 33</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani opened her eyes. The view was white and brightly lit.
The air felt cool and carried the characteristic odor she had long ago dubbed
hospital-metallic. She took a deep breath and stretched her arms. Both of them.
One was phantom. The real one was encased from wrist to shoulder in a membrane
bandage filled with clear allerjel. Jani shook it. The jelly sloshed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
When she tired of that, she sat up, wedged her pillow behind
the small of her back for balance, and studied the watercolors hung on the wall
opposite her bed. One was a seascape in greys and greens, the other, a
gold-and-brown still life. Jani had spent most of the past few days picking out
details in the paintings, little nuances she’d missed during previous
examinations. If she concentrated hard enough on the exercise, she could almost
forget certain things. Why she was in hospital, for example, and what had
happened to put her there.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
And more immediately, what lay beneath her covers. Or
rather, what didn’t.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani carefully ignored the telltale flatness of her
bedspread. As long as she didn’t look, she could pretend her left leg was still
there. She could feel it, after all, like the missing arm. Funny how its
absence bothered her more. <i class="calibre4">It’s the vulnerability</i>, she thought, in a
rare attempt at self-analysis. <i class="calibre4">You can still run with one arm</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But run from whom? Calvin Montoya had been her only visitor
thus far. He checked in on her five or six times a day, examining her with
sure, gentle hands, a joke or a piece of gossip always at the ready.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The details of what had occurred at Interior Main, however,
she’d had to pull from him with pliers.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The doctor and nurse from the Interior infirmary were still
alive. Their encounter with Jani and the IV rack had netted them two
concussions and one skull fracture. And three-month suspensions without pay for
not notifying Montoya immediately of their singular patient. <i class="calibre4">They were
arguing about me and looking things up in textbooks</i>. Her right film must
have broken while she was unconscious; they’d probably seen her eye. One
glimpse of that pale green orb would certainly be enough to drive any medico to
the reference materials.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her left calf itched. She tried to ignore it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I did lots of damage that night</i>. Evan’s knee would
never be the same. After suffering torn ligaments and a dislocated kneecap, his
evening went rapidly downhill. The Justice Minister himself placed him under
arrest. The warrant was served upon Evan in his well-guarded hospital suite,
with Cao and Ulanova serving as the Greek chorus. All the major networks had
been invited to record the unprecedented event.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Calvin had brought Jani a copy of the local CapNet
broadcast. The wafer still lay atop her holoVee console, its seal unbroken.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She stared at the seascape. Contained by a pewter frame as
shiny as summer, sunlight played on gentle waves. How often on Shèrá had Evan
told her about his sailing adventures on the Earthbound lakes? His expression
had always grown melancholy as he spoke; those were the only times she could
recall him appearing at all homesick. <i class="calibre4">Are they letting you have a drink, Ev?
Are they letting you have anything else</i>? Montoya had seemed worried. He had
heard rumors of a suicide watch.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani twirled a corner of her blanket and switched her
attention to the still life. A tasteful piece, nothing exceptional. Something
Ulanova would hang in her dining room.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I can imagine the conversations ringing around that table</i>.
The gloating comments, the laughter. <i class="calibre4">Revenge is a dish best savored cold, to
be served with the appetizers and the iced cocktails</i>. To those with the
stomach for it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Leaves me out—I don’t have the stomach for much, anymore</i>.
Lucien had tried to visit her several times, but she refused to see him and
rejected his bouquets of flowers. Ate without appetite when she ate at all.
Ignored the holoVee and stacks of magazines and newssheets.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya managed to hide his frustration beneath a cloak of
humor and delicate prodding. <i class="calibre4">He threatened to toss me out into a snowdrift
last night</i>. During this morning’s examination, he assured her he’d push the
skimchair himself if she’d just agree to a jaunt up and down the hall.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani’s refusal had plunged him into watchful silence. His
examination took a good deal longer than usual. He withheld his usual
inquiries, but he also drew more blood and took more swab samples. The only
time he spoke was when he announced what he was going to do, inviting her
questions. Her response that he should just take it all and get it over with
jolted him. As he left, Jani had heard the doorbolt slide into place.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
So she’d slept for a few hours, studied the ceiling, slept
some more, studied her paintings.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The door eased open, and a cautious Montoya poked his head
into the room. “Ah, Jani. You’re awake.” He entered, pulling a wheeled trolley.
A large black plastic bag rested on the trolley’s top shelf. “If this doesn’t
get you out of that bed, I’m going to fill your membrane bandage with detonator
gel and whack it with a hammer.” He patted the plastic bag like a proud father.
“Your new limbs are here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sat up straighter. “Already?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“At Neoclona, we aim to please,” Montoya said breezily,
emboldened by her interest. “Get ready, milady,” he said as he opened the door
of an inset wall cabinet. “I intend to have you walking within the hour.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani kept her attention focused on the plastic bag. “I’ve
only been here four days.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“A standard arm takes a week to assemble. A leg takes at
least two.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Under normal conditions, that’s certainly true.” Montoya
approached her bedside carrying a small metal tray on which instruments
rattled. “But in your case, some preparations had already been made.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How?” Jani swallowed as the doctor placed the tray on her
end table. Several long, pointed probes glistened in the light. “Why?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya activated one of the probes, pulled down the left
shoulder of Jani’s medgown, and began prodding the smooth, shooter-burned
membrane that served as the interface between her animandroid arm and the rest of
her. “Once one reaches a certain level in Neoclona, your file becomes required
reading.” He worked around the outer rim of the junction, searching for dead
spots. “The wise facility chief knows to be prepared.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tried in vain to keep from flinching as needling
tingles radiated throughout the hypersensitive junction. “What are you telling
me?” she asked through gritted teeth. “That every Neo shop in the Commonwealth
has a set of left-siders with my name on it sitting in a cold drawer?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya adjusted the shoulder of her gown and pulled up a
corner of the hem. “I’m going to check the thigh junction now.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You didn’t answer my question.” Jani grabbed a fistful of
sheet and found a riveting light fixture on the wall opposite to focus on.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The answer should be obvious, Jani,” Montoya said as he
probed, “to you more than anyone.” After eliciting a couple of bearable
twinges, he pronounced both junctions functional. Jani rearranged her gown as
best she could while maintaining her shaky balance. Meanwhile, Montoya opened
another of the room’s recessed cabinets and rolled out a tall, silver monolith.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani watched him activate touchpads and enter codes. The
limb sealer came to life with a characteristic hum. “Why replacements? Why not
just fix the old ones?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Coming back to ourselves, are we?” The physician smiled
absently, his attention focused on the instrument. “So many questions.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And so few answers.” Jani’s stomach hadn’t ached at all up
to that point. She only noticed it in contrast. Now, it hurt like hell. “Why
replace what you can fix?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
As Montoya pushed the limb sealer over to the bed, two disc
covers on the instrument face slid open, revealing twin depressions. The upper
one was small and green, the lower one large and dark blue. They looked like a
pair of misshapen eyes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The reason for the new arm should be obvious. As for the
leg—” Montoya hesitated. “I believe you’ll find your back problems will be a
distant memory once it’s attached.” He bumped the sealer up against the bed.
The frame resonated in time to the sealer’s vibration. Jani could feel the
humming buzz in her teeth. “We’ll do the arm first, I think. Then you’ll have
more leverage when we do the leg. Push your junction against the green.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani lowered the shoulder of her gown and pressed her stump
into the shallow saucer. Tingling pressure radiated across her upper back as
the disc membrane closed around the junction.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re implying the leg wasn’t balanced. I had no problem
with it for over seventeen years. My back just started acting up in the last
six months.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya disappeared behind the sealer. Jani heard his
footsteps, followed by the whine of a zipper, a <i class="calibre4">pop</i>, and a rush of air
as he removed the arm from its vacuum casing. “We change as we get older, Jani.
Our bone density, muscle mass. Your animandroid limbs were older models in the
first place—they stood no chance of keeping up the pace. In a more conventional
environment, you’d have had them changed out three or four times by now.” The
sealer vibration ramped. “Press against the saucer,” he said, peeking around
the unit at Jani. “Hold your breath on three. Ready? One. Two. Three.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani pushed, inhaled. She felt a burning as the junction
sintered, then split down the middle, exposing her shoulder joint. She felt as
well as heard the soft click as new bone met old. Then came warmth as synthon
lubricant flowed through the junction and into the joint, followed by the
suction smack as tissue met bioadhesive.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Looks good. Pull out, please.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani eased her new arm through the newly opened gap in the
saucer. She rolled her shoulder, bent her elbow, counted off on her fingers to
check—“<i class="calibre4">Hey</i>!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya poked his head around the sealer, which he appeared
to be using as a shield. “Is something wrong?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani winced as she pressed fingernails into fingertips. “I
can feel with these.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Of course.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I couldn’t before.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“An adjustment long overdue, don’t you think?” The dark head
again disappeared. “I’m going to call in someone to help with the leg.” He left
the room, returning soon with a burly nurse in tow.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
This bout with the sealer proved clumsier, not to mention
more painful. Tears blurred Jani’s vision as she made a circuit of the room
under Montoya’s watchful eye. She muttered a prayer of thanks to whoever had
the presence of mind to slip a pair of underpants beneath the gaping medgown.
“You’re right, Doctor. My back does feel better.” She hopped up and down a few
times. “I didn’t realize people could change so much at the ripe old age of
forty-two.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The nurse glanced sidelong at Montoya, then excused himself
with a curt nod. Once they were alone, Montoya pulled out a lazor and cut away
the allerjel packing from Jani’s right arm. As she washed away the gooey
remains of the soothing jelly, he scrounged a set of medwhites and a pair of
lab shoes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hungry, Jani? Allow me to buy you a very late lunch.” He
handed her the clothes. “I’m getting you out of this damned room if it’s the
last thing I do.” His dark eyes danced. “As reward, I’ll tell you the exciting
tale of how you got here in the first place.”
</p>

</p>

<p class="NormalFirst">
“We escaped Interior Main a heartbeat ahead of Ulanova’s
people.” Montoya forked through a tomato-sauced omelet, with occasional stabs
at a green salad. “Your blond friend, that lieutenant, knew whom to look out
for, which areas to avoid. He and the young red-haired man—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani choked on her soup. “Steve! I told him to stay in
Private.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, he obviously didn’t listen. He and Pascal bundled you
onto a skimdolly he had purloined from the loading dock. Much bickering went on
during this time. I gather Pascal found Steve wandering the Main halls in a
furtive manner and set upon him. Steve had a black eye—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why the hell did Lucien hit him!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—which went nicely with Pascal’s air of ‘last one
standing.’ They declared a truce when they realized your welfare was at stake,
but it was shaky at best.” Montoya dabbed a few beads of sweat from his brow.
“I discovered during that time I wasn’t cut out for excitement.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I couldn’t have been too exciting,” Jani said. “All an
augie does after a take-down is sleep and toss around a lot.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya grimaced. “Your augment was the only thing keeping
you alive. After I took you down, you began to slip into anaphylactic shock.
Your blood pressure went into the basement—” He stabbed his fork at her like a
fencing foil. “Those two morons knew that goddamn sedative patch was
contraindicated in your case, and they used it anyway! Three-month
suspensions—if they think it ends there, they’re in for a grim surprise. Even <i class="calibre4">with</i>
your augment, you could have died in that infirmary. The fact that you went on
to do what you did . . .” He faltered and took it out on his
salad, stabbing the vegetables into mashed submission.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani studied the view over Montoya’s shoulder. The small
dining hall was empty except for the two of them. Purple in all its shades
dominated the color scheme, from tinged white walls to lilac grey floor and
nearly black furniture. The funereal surroundings turned the mind to things
best forgotten. “I killed Durian Ridgeway,” she said quietly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Did you?” Montoya’s chewing slowed. He set down his fork
and pushed aside his half-eaten meal. “Pascal’s skimmer was parked outside the
docks. It was too small for the four of us. The situation became even more
interesting when a hyperactive bundle of winter clothing bounded out to us yelling,
‘Steve, Steve,’ in a singularly feminine tone. Pascal pulled out his shooter,
which caused Steve to spring for his throat like a cat. At that point, your
blood pressure took another dive and the bundle started screaming that Exterior
Security was hot on her trail.” Montoya exhaled with a shudder. “Amazing how we
suddenly all managed to fit into Pascal’s vehicle. He took us as far as the
boundary between Exterior and the Shèrá Embassy. I’m still trying to assimilate
what happened next. <i class="calibre4">Tsecha</i> was waiting for us outside an Exterior
guardpost. The idomeni ambassador.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani pushed her plate aside. The little she had eaten froze
in her stomach. “Tsecha?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya nodded. “He drove us here. In an Exterior skimmer
Pascal took great pleasure in telling us the ambassador had stolen. He wore
eyefilms. Makeup. And an evening suit. Pascal treated this like it was the most
normal thing in the world. Steve and his bundle, a young woman named Angevin,
blinked perhaps twice, then piled you into the backseat of the ambassador’s
skimmer and shouted for me to, and I quote, ‘hurry the fuck up.’” He sighed.
“So I did.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">He knows I’m alive</i>. Did she ever really doubt he’d
discover the fact? What had he told her on the Academy steps, when she handed
him back his ring and told him she had every intention of remaining human until
she died.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">You will never die, nìa</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well,” she said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Indeed.” Montoya nodded absently. “Tsecha is a proponent of
what he calls evading. He evaded us down side streets and alleys I never knew
existed, and I’ve lived here all my life. We took corners at complete
verticals. I yelled that if he didn’t slow down, I was going to tear his head
off. I couldn’t keep you still enough to intubate you. Time was running out.
Your throat was swelling shut. The shockpack alarm was blaring.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani eyed the entry. <i class="calibre4">He wouldn’t come here, would he</i>?
Risk his Temple’s wrath and the Commonwealth’s anger by calling upon a
murderer. <i class="calibre4">Of course he would—he thinks killing is just something I do</i>.
Part of the job description. Eyes and Ears . . . destroyer of
diplomatic relations . . . toxin . . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya rattled on, a captive in his own recollective jet
stream. “He just smiled, if you can call what he does a smile, and told me,
‘Ah, Doctor, you know my Captain will outlive us all.’ I commented that that
could be by a grand total of five seconds if we slammed into the side of a
building. He then slowed down just long enough for me to reinsert and anchor
the endotracheal tube.” He bit his well-buffed fingernails one at a time. Just
a nip here and there, an old broken habit undergoing spontaneous reassembly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So you were getting air. Thank God. We were being pursued,
you know, until Tsecha started <i class="calibre4">evading</i>. The lieutenant had drawn his
shooter, and the ambassador . . . he was armed, as well. A
shooter in a chest holster. Knives up both sleeves.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani’s throat felt dry and tight. “He would have used them,
too.” She stole a sip of water from Montoya’s glass. “Idomeni martial order
broke down after Knevçet Shèràa. Self-protection became the order of the day,
even for those who had never had to think about it before. Nema always adapted
quickly to change.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Nema?” Montoya’s eyebrows arched. “Oh, Tsecha’s born name.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He changed it after the war ended. Then he went into
seclusion in his Temple enclave for five of our years.” Jani’s gaze kept
veering toward the cafeteria entry. “And with all they knew about his beliefs,
they still let him out of his cage.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya nodded. “I’ve heard about those beliefs. That
someday, the human and idomeni races will be as one.” He played with his fork.
“Did you feel the same way when you studied with him? Did you buy what he sold
the way Hansen Wyle did?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The sudden sharpening of Calvin Montoya’s voice didn’t
surprise Jani. Anyone who had won John Shroud’s confidence couldn’t have been
as ingenuous as he first appeared. “Hansen believed. But I think he enjoyed the
thrill of it all, too. He liked flipping it off in people’s faces.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He died in an air raid a few hours before he was going to
try to negotiate you away from my boss.” Montoya smoothed away a ragged nail
edge. “Seems to me our alien ambassador isn’t the only one capable of making
associates ignore their better judgment.” He eyed her pointedly. “Let’s get out
of here,” he said, gesturing toward a fluted paper cup nestled beside her soup
bowl. “Take those. Chew and swallow them.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why?” Jani sniffed the dark brown tablets. They smelled
like chocolate fudge made with sour cream. “What are they?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Enzyme tablets. They’ll help you digest your food.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What’s wrong with my digestion?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It needs help.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“There’s no time, Jani. Just trust that it’s for your own
good.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ve heard that before.” Jani chewed dutifully, chasing the
bitter, gritty mass down with a swallow of water. “John’s favorite line.
Whatever happened next either hurt like hell or made me sick.” The increased
sensation in her left leg still jarred her, and she half walked, half hopped as
she followed Montoya out of the dining hall.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
It didn’t surprise her that Lucien Pascal waited for them
near the nurses’ station, or that he carried her duffel as though he owned it.
He looked tired; thin lines of scabs dotted one cheek. He offered her a cool
nod, then turned to Montoya. “Think she’s up to it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Montoya’s nails again found their way to his mouth. “No. But
it would be no next week as well. No right into next month, but we don’t have
the time, do we?” Muttering curses in Earthbound Spanish, Montoya ducked behind
the nurses’ station.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re not ready,” he said as he emerged carrying a small
polyfilm bag. “There’s too much that needs to be talked about. Too much left up
in the air. But I’ve been ordered to let you go anyway.” He thrust the bag into
Jani’s hands. “The directions are in with the tablets. When you run out, stop
at any facility. You have nothing to worry about, Jani. You’re being seen to.
If you don’t trust anything I’ve told you, trust that.” He squeezed her hand,
glared at Lucien, then strode down the hall without a backward glance.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani turned to Lucien. “What’s going on?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He pantomimed an explosion. “All hell’s broken loose.” He
gestured for her to follow and walked to a side door labeled, EMERGENCY EXIT
ONLY. “We need to get you through as many GateWays as possible as soon as
possible,” he said as he ushered her though the door. “But before that, there’s
someone who wants to see you.”
