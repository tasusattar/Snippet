<p class="NormalFirst">
Tsecha shifted against the rigid metal frame of his
uncushioned chair and watched the Xhà Pathen representative state her skein’s
case against the laes. Xhà did not possess the fluidity of Vynshàrau, or even
of Laum. The female jerked rather than gestured; her voice sounded as though
she spoke in a metal box. Tsecha looked away from her twitching form, focusing
instead on a favored sculpture. But even smooth riverstone failed to please
him. His back ached. His head throbbed. He had lost patience with the
mind-focusing ability of pain.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
When the female finished, Tsecha nodded in acknowledgment of
her statement of position, then gestured for her to go, neglecting the
customary benediction. She hesitated, waiting for the blessing, but he slashed
the air again with his right hand. More roughly, this time. An insult.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I will hear of this from the Oligarch</i>, he thought
glumly as the Xhà Pathen left him. Pathen-descended Haárin controlled much of
the trade with Outer Circle humanish. They also claimed strong loyalty to their
former born-sect. Tsecha sensed an upcoming trade slowdown. Perhaps even a
strike.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A strike. How humanish of Haárin. <i class="calibre4">So well do they blend,
even now</i>. Most as hybrid, even without the outward physical signs. The
signs he and John Shroud had spoken of such a long time past as they sat on the
Academy veranda, warmed by the sun and a blessedly hot breeze, and argued the
possibilities of change.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But the reality of change is most different, and truly</i>.
The agent of change, his toxin, resided as prisoner within the bounds of
Interior and needed to be freed. Did she even know herself to be imprisoned?
Tsecha hoped not. Kilian’s reactions under such conditions had, after all,
proven unpredictable, even by her own kind.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My odd Lucien is to liberate her this night</i>. The
thought made him uneasy. He did not fully trust his new guide. His dead Hansen
had desired order of a sort, but Lucien seemed most content when all around him
were confused. The Tsecha who had fought in a war rose from his cursed chair
and massaged his numb thighs. <i class="calibre4">Confusion</i> and <i class="calibre4">rescue mission</i>, he
felt most sure, were not a desirable combination.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
His meeting with the Prime Minister had been put off until
afternoon, so Tsecha retired to the quiet of his rooms. He studied the space,
which appeared much larger than it truly was owing to the sparseness of its
furnishings. <i class="calibre4">My Captain could hide here</i>. He bared his teeth at the disorder
of the thought. <i class="calibre4">She could sleep under my bed</i>. During the day, she could
labor at his workstation, deal with his tiresome duties, explain to him what he
must do to survive humanish meetings.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But what would she eat</i>? The prospect of sharing food
bothered him, but if such was what the gods demanded, he would allow his
Captain his food. What she could eat of it. <i class="calibre4">She could grow ill</i>. He
lowered himself into his favored chair and pulled at his red-trimmed sleeves. <i class="calibre4">She
could die</i>. John had warned of such. The nutritional requirements of a
hybrid would change constantly as its body altered. A food that once nourished
could act as poison a short time later. A wretched, wasting death, which would
bring an end to the future as well as his Captain’s life.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">No</i>. Tsecha settled back in his chair and contemplated
a curve of polished sandwood in a niche across the room. <i class="calibre4">She cannot stay
here</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A sharp series of tones rang out, jolting him from his
reverie. <i class="calibre4">A call to sacrament</i>? He glanced at the timeform at his
workplace. <i class="calibre4">No, it is too early</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The tones sounded once more. Tsecha slowly approached his
comport. Across the surface of the device’s input pad, illumins flashed and
fluttered. “Someone has called me?” But the unit did not allow incoming
messages, and no other possessed his code.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">This lacks order</i>. Tsecha activated the device’s
audio. <i class="calibre4">Thus do I know who calls</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Ah</i>. “Lieutenant Pascal, this comport does not accept
incoming.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A pause. “It does now.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha bared his teeth and waited.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau?” His lieutenant sounded youngish now. Plaintive.
Then, like the turning of a page, the tone changed, becoming harsh. “I won’t be
selling it to the newssheets, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I detect anger</i>. Good to know his disorderly guide
could be vexed. He dragged his chair by the comport table and sat.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau, would you please activate your video?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, Lucien.” Tsecha fingered the input pad. A side view of
his guide’s face filled the display. “I am most surprised to hear from you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Obviously.” Lucien kept his head turned. Below the level of
the display, his hands worked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha saw a flash of white. Another. “Lieutenant?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My apologies, nìRau—I’m experiencing a technical
difficulty.” He at last held up a folded square of cloth and pressed it to the
side of his face that Tsecha couldn’t see.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Lucien?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Lower the cloth.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, it’s—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Lower it!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Slowly, Lucien did as he was told.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha touched his own face when he saw the four ragged,
seeping gouges that ran from the middle of Lucien’s cheek to the edge of his
high Service collar. He recalled the humanish custom of sharing their homes
with animals. “You were scratched by a pet, Lucien?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien’s lips curved. “You could say that, nìRau.” The
expression altered to a grimace and he again pressed the cloth to his wounds.
“I’ve had a lousy day so far.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It will soon become worse.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Thank you. I wouldn’t have known that without you telling
me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then it is good we speak now, so I can remind you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What would I do without you, nìRau?” Lucien lifted the
cloth from his face and stared at the crosshatches of blood. “There’s been a
murder, nìRau. A young woman. A documents examiner. Kilian knew her.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha felt a tightening in his soul. “Did my Captain kill
her?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why would you think that, nìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The past—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Is the past.” Lucien shook his head. “Kilian wasn’t in the
Main House at the time of the murder.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And how do you know this, Lucien?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I have a source.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ah, a spy.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ah.” Tsecha looked at his lieutenant, who had now become
most as a wall. “This killing worries you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Kilian was working with the dead girl, nìRau. They were
investigating Lyssa van Reuter’s death and its connection to what happened at
Knevçet Shèràa.” The bright redness of Lucien’s wounds made his skin seem most
pale. “But we all know the connection. Acton van Reuter and Rikart Neumann were
friends. After Kilian killed Neumann, van Reuter arranged the transport
explosion. He did it for self-protection and to avenge Neumann’s death. But
there must be something else.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Something else?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Another connection we’re all missing.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“All will be connected in the end, Lucien. Such is the root
of order.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau, I can’t use philosophy now—I need facts.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha slumped against hard cushions. How often had he and
Hansen argued of this? <i class="calibre4">There has to be something else, Nema</i>! His guide
had stalked his rooms at Temple like a hunting animal. <i class="calibre4">How the hell did the
order to blow up the transport get to the depot outside Knevçet Shèràa</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Does it matter?” Tsecha spoke as much to his dead friend as
to the face on the display. “All we do affects all we know. A deed performed by
one is a deed performed by all.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The sins of the fathers, nìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sins are sins, Lucien—they taint the sect as a whole. That
is why those who sin most greatly are made Haárin, to excise them from the
whole and save the souls of their brethren.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ok then,” Lucien sighed, “who in Interior House would you
make Haárin?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha bared his teeth. “My Captain, Lucien.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien emitted a guttural, Haárin-like sound. “That’s not
the answer I’m looking for, nìRau, and you know it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But that is the answer you will receive from me. She must
be excised from the rest of humanish. She does not belong with you any longer.
She must be allowed to become what she must.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Which is?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She is toxin. The agent of change. She is change’s spy.” He
felt a tremor of satisfaction. <i class="calibre4">I thought of such without my handheld</i>. He
was finally becoming used to this English.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s very poetic, nìRau.” Lucien touched his cheek and
moaned softly. “I plan to excuse myself from my meeting tonight and track her
down within Main.” For the first time, he looked Tsecha in the eye. “Eight
o’clock, nìRau. One-half hour after the finish of midevening sacrament. You
must be at your outpost with your Exterior skimmer, charged up and ready.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">So he knows of that as well</i>? Tsecha studied Lucien’s
face in return. Through the display, it did not seem such an intrusion. <i class="calibre4">Most
as Haárin, my odd one’s eyes</i>. From a sheltered corner of his memory, he
heard the tensile song of blades being pulled from sheaths. “Yes, Lucien. For
her to live is necessary for us both. You have chosen her as your dominant;
thus you owe her your knife.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My dominant? Yes, I suppose you’re right.” Lucien cocked
his head. The gesture was not as idomeni. He looked as a humanish who contemplated
the lines of a sculpture, or an object in a niche. “And you’ve chosen her for
something else. Does she know what you plan for her?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">He knows</i>! How much as Hansen he was, after all. “You
know of the blending?” Tsecha asked. “The hybridization? You know of what is to
be?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ve read your prewar essays, nìRau.” Lucien wadded his
bloody bandage and flung it out of range of the display. “I can’t say I accept
your conclusions.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Ah</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But you want her to live, and I can’t save her by myself.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I will be there, Lucien.” Tsecha watched his lieutenant
carefully. “With my stolen skimmer.” At that, Lucien’s mouth curved upward, as
he had hoped. Before he could say more, a more familiar series of chords echoed
through the rooms. “I must go now,” he said as the last series rang.
“Midmorning sacrament. I will offer prayers for our success tonight.” He waited
for Lucien to nod before disconnecting. The screen blanked. He meditated upon
the greyness.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">No, not as Hansen. Something quite different, I believe,
and truly</i>. He smoothed a hand over the front of his overrobe, then reached
for his handheld and picked at the touchpad. But the meanings he plumbed from
the device’s depths failed to help him. <i class="calibre4">He chose my Captain</i>. This young
lieutenant whose eyes, whose soul, seemed wrapped in a death-glaze that could
not be seen. The clatter of dishes and utensils reached Tsecha through the
closed door. He felt a small rush of comfort at the sounds.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">He chose me</i>. The summoning illumin shone. He rose.
His soul felt heavy. <i class="calibre4">This strange, dead humanish</i>. He could not keep his
mind focused upon his prayers, and pleaded with his gods for understanding.
