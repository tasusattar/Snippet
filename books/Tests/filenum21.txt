<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_30">Chapter 17</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
A jovial “Come in, Risa” sounded through the door just as
Jani raised her hand to knock. The panel swung open in a whispery combination
of mechanics and the brush of door edge over expensive carpet. She stepped onto
the dark grey pile and experienced the fleeting sensation of the ground giving
way beneath her as her boots sank in to just below the ankle.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Original artwork she recognized from holozines decorated the
light grey walls. As she crossed the room toward Ridgeway, ensconced behind his
desk, she was treated to a wall-spanning backdrop of the lake, tastefully muted
through glare-filtering scanglass. <i class="calibre4">Large body of water as office
accessory—very nice</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway made no effort to rise until Jani reached his desk.
Only then did he execute a quick half-up-and-be-seated. His smile held the same
consideration. “Nice of you to be so prompt,” he muttered breathlessly as he
gestured for her to sit. “It’s been a hell of a day.” An errant lock of hair
provided emphasis by flopping over his forehead.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Hope I helped</i>. Jani smiled wanly and held her tongue.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I do try to promote an environment which is conducive to
cooperation, Risa—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I doubt that</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—and Lord knows I’m no micromanager—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I’d have guessed pico</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—but is it too much to expect a reasoned approach to tasks
at hand? Circumspection? Forethought? Is it too much to ask of people that they
think things through?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
As though on cue, the door opened, and Ridgeway’s aide
entered. He still looked like the enemy artillery barrage had stretched into
the third day with no end in sight. Jani shot a “take heart” grin at him, but
he avoided her eye as he placed a black-edged file folder on the desk in front
of Ridgeway.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Thank you, Greer.” Ridgeway’s smile curdled as he opened
the folder, positioning it so Jani couldn’t see what it contained, and paged
through it while Greer exited silently. Then, eyes bright and predatory, he
leaned across the desk and splayed the folder’s contents over the bare,
polished bloodwood in front of her. “A rendezvous in the snow,” he said,
triumph causing his voice to quaver. “How romantic.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani surveyed what lay before her. Sceneshots—one short
sequence per panel. Snippets of action, intercutting middle distance and zoom,
replayed themselves every few seconds in a rolling series. The holographer had
been selective. The first display showed her diving behind the log, but not her
scrabble for rocks. The angle and replay speed of the second sequence made her
attempted flattening of Lucien look like a playful shove. The third scene
stopped just as Lucien flipped her on her back. The overall impression given was,
to say the least, incriminating.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Just some playful precoital wrestling. Never mind the
windchill—lust conquers all</i>. Jani pulled in a slow, painful breath. She’d
checked the condition of her stiff upper back in a restroom mirror upon her
return to Interior Main. The dinner-plate-sized bruise had bloomed nicely,
thank you, Lucien.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The fourth scene showed her and the lieutenant making their
way down the forest path, the angle of the shot hiding the shooter trained on
her back.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Circumspection.” Ridgeway clucked softly. “Forethought. You
aren’t the first slimy little traitor to lack either of those vital qualities.”
His gloating smile threatened to split his face in two. “Your ass is mine now,
Tyi. Evan won’t let you get away with this.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked from Ridgeway to the sceneshots with a lack of
concern that bothered her in an abstract way. It was as though she watched the
missteps of a character in a play. Augie picked the damnedest times to overstay
his welcome. Ridgeway apparently wondered at her reaction as well. His smile
wavered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Interesting,” she managed, eliciting sounds of choking from
across the desk. On another level, her mind raced. A frame, but by whom? <i class="calibre4">Ulanova</i>?
She seemed petty enough, jealous of what she perceived to be Lucien’s
attachment. <i class="calibre4">But you’d think she’d try to wring something out of me before
hanging me out to dry</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ms. Tyi, you are in a great deal of trouble, you know. I’ve
been informed the man in these sceneshots is mainline Service. An Exterior
Ministry Security officer.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Could be the PM</i>. Keeping tabs on her prodigal van
Reuter, trolling for tidbits. <i class="calibre4">Or any of the other ministers, for that
matter—they wouldn’t even have to be anti-Evan, necessarily</i>. Hell, anyone
who could adapt a holoremote to get past sensescan could have taken those shots.
Newssheets. Gossip rags. Lucien, the gadget expert, for the hell of it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Bâtard</i>, indeed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway cocked his head. “Are you listening to me, Ms.
Tyi?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sat back. Her chair was designed to make the occupant
feel off-balance—spindly, hard of seat, and tilted forward slightly. It didn’t
work. For visitor intimidation, Ridgeway should have tried idomeni furniture.
Jani had, on countless occasions, sat through hours-long Academy exams in
chairs that had treated her back in much the same way Lucien had.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I doubt you did this,” she said to Ridgeway, indicating the
panels. “If you had, I don’t believe you’d have bothered to show them to me
first. You would have gone directly to His Excellency.” She gripped her
armrests as a helium bubble expanded in the depths of her skull. “And here you
probably felt like Christmas made a second pass.” She took a deep breath in an
effort to dispel her lightheadedness. “Sorry to disappoint.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway leaned so far forward he was in danger of pitching
out of his chair. “You are a traitor—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Speaking of traitors,” Jani interrupted, “I’ve come upon
something interesting.” The calmness of her voice fascinated her. She’d never
been adept at extemporaneous self-defense—the results reflected in her Service
record. Augie never bothered to kick in at those lower stress levels. So why
was he being so helpful now? “His Excellency’s father apparently made hash of
the Bilateral Accord some years ago. He colluded with the Laumrau during the
idomeni civil war and managed to have some of their augmentation technology
smuggled back to Earth. Martin, it seems, paid the bulk of the fine for that
particular violation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Careful how you speculate,” Ridgeway said. His eyes still
shone, but his voice had weakened.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The technology came from a research hospital, a place
called Knevçet Shèràa.” Jani bit out the <i class="calibre4">c</i> as Ulanova had, gave “Shèràa”
the two-syllable treatment instead of entoning the double-<i class="calibre4">a</i> upturn at
the end, and sat on her hands to avoid gesturing. God, she hated sounding like
an Earthbound hick. “Rumor has it that in order to eliminate possible
witnesses, he ordered the deaths of the Service troops stationed there. Just
imagine, multiple counts of premeditated murder. Oh, and let’s not forget the
treason.” She smiled. “Nice to have something in common with a man of Acton van
Reuter’s standing, I suppose.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway licked his lips. “Acton’s dead,” he said. From his
tone, he didn’t seem altogether sure.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, but the sins of the father, Durian. They matter to
idomeni, and they make humans sit up as well. The shrapnel from this bombshell
just might take out our boss.” She looked into Ridgeway’s eyes. <i class="calibre4">Don’t tell
me you didn’t know</i>. Oh, he knew—knowing went a long way toward explaining
his lack of cooperation in providing her Evan’s documents.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway fingered his chin. “Risa—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh, it’s “Risa” again, is it</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—I don’t know what to say.” He appeared genuinely
thoughtful. “Lieutenant Pascal told you this?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">So, no one traced me to the Parkway—sloppy</i>. That
implied a stationary cam, perhaps in the Private House. Well, it saved a lot of
explaining, although it did make Jani wonder how secure her office really was.
“The information was there for the taking.” No reason to disclose who offered
it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway’s manner became very clipped. Perhaps he associated
that with professionalism. “Did Pascal attempt to interfere with you in any way
while he served as your steward on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Now it was Jani’s turn to sound surprised. “So you knew
about that?” Ridgeway’s stare offered no reply. “Nothing I couldn’t handle.”
She thought back to her lunches with Lucien. They had spent most of the time
laughing over whatever human weakness he had exploited that particular
ship-day. “I think he’d grown used to manipulating through his looks and charm.
I saw no reason to disabuse him of his notion.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway nodded sagely. “Brave of you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shrugged. “Solo older woman coming in from a long-term
colony assignment. He probably figured me for an easy target.” She looked away
from Ridgeway’s developing smirk. <i class="calibre4">I’ll be sorry I said that</i>. Big mouth
returns. Looked like augie had finally folded his tent.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway swung his feet onto his desk. He’d changed clothes
since their morning altercation. His pale green socks peeked through the gap
between his black half boots and coal grey trousers. They matched his loosened
neckpiece, which in turn contrasted nicely with his medium grey shirt. <i class="calibre4">Occupant
as office accessory—very nice</i>. The look he bestowed on Jani wouldn’t have
qualified as friendly. More like superior, but without the gloat. “Will you
continue to see this man?” He wasn’t quite able to control the lively curiosity
in his voice. The idea of operating as a pimp for the House seemed to appeal to
him.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll play it for as long as it runs,” Jani replied blandly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It bothers me that Ulanova has zeroed in on Acton again.”
Ridgeway pursed his lips. “She’d gone after him once before, of course, but
that was before his death. Oh, dear Anais had her claws out for him—make no
mistake. Back in the Dark Ages, he alternated between undercutting Scriabin
business concerns and aiming Anais’s younger sister at David Scriabin.
Unfortunately, David was engaged to Anais at the time. The scandal when David
and Milla eloped was horrendous. Poor Anais never really recovered from the
humiliation.” He glanced at Jani and smiled coolly. “I appreciate your help,
Risa, really I do. I understand what it must have taken out of you. Do you
suppose any of this may tie in with Lyssa’s death?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stifled a yawn. Her head felt heavy—a nap sounded
tempting. But she wanted to visit the Library. Then she needed to get ready for
dinner with Evan. “It was implied to me that several Families were involved in
the importation of the augmentation technology. If you believe Lyssa had
discovered what had been done to her son and was trying to figure out who was
responsible at the time of her death . . .” She let the sentence
peter out, punctuating the silence with a raised eyebrow.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Good God!” Ridgeway became positively buoyant, no doubt
envisioning how many of Evan’s rivals he could scuttle by linking them to a
murder plot. “I’m going to have to meet with Colonel Doyle as soon as
possible.” He sat up straight and tightened his neckpiece. “Well, you’ve blown
my evening all to hell, Risa, but I think the results may well prove worth the
inconvenience.” He hesitated noticeably. “You’re welcome to sit in, of course.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You—” Jani stopped her personal commentary in time. “You
are too kind, Durian, but I’ll be dining with His Excellency this evening.” She
ignored his arch look. “By the way, those files we discussed this morning.
Could I have them, please?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Of course.” Ridgeway grinned. Grin, hell, he bubbled. In a
week, he’d be telling people hiring Risa Tyi was his idea. “In fact,” he said,
“let’s get some drudgery out of the way now.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A few intercommed orders to the frazzled Greer later, Jani
found herself in possession of a Class A Interior expense voucher (no manager
approval necessary unless she tried to buy something substantial, like
Chicago), parts bin and repair chits, and other pieces of paper and plastic
designed to make the favored Interior employee’s life easier. The promised
files, however, were held up in document limbo. Jani would have to wait for
those until tomorrow. Ridgeway apologized profusely as he walked her all the
way to the outer-office door, adding they would have to have dinner “very
soon.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Can’t wait</i>. Jani trudged down the hall, wondering
what exactly she had opened herself up to. True, she’d gotten Ridgeway off her
back, but it crossed her mind he might attempt to reap some of the benefits he
thought her to be bestowing on Lucien and Evan. She wandered down the wrong
hallway, backtracked, then found herself standing before the doorway leading to
the alternate breakroom. <i class="calibre4">What would I do</i>? Probably whatever he wanted.
Ridgeway, Jani sensed, was the sort of man who thought staking a claim in a
woman’s vagina locked up the rest of her as well. A risky assumption, but
fortunately, not a rare one. On more than one occasion, her continued good
health had depended upon her working that assumption to its limits.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Sometimes, it’s whatever gets you from here to there</i>.
She was glad to find the breakroom empty. She spent a few minutes straightening
the snack table, then cleaned and reloaded the brewer. Soon the aroma of fresh coffee
filled the room and her stomach, having recovered from its bout with Ascertane,
responded by growling each time she inhaled. She rummaged around for a cup,
then settled into a battered corner seat.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Ridgeway let me off easy. He could have bounced me off
three walls and the ceiling besides, and he caved as soon as I brought up Acton</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Nimble little counter-jumper</i>, Anais Ulanova would
have said. <i class="calibre4">Knows how to keep his feet under him</i>. One option, if Ridgeway
felt Jani had uncovered knowledge he wished to keep buried, would be to shower
her with bounty. She reached into her shirt pocket for the expense voucher.
Silver, in contrast to Lucien’s red, with a discreet scripted <i class="calibre4">a</i> in the
lower left hand corner that she hadn’t recalled seeing on the lieutenant’s card.
<i class="calibre4">Anything within reason, and maybe a thing or two without</i>, Ridgeway had
said when he handed it to her. <i class="calibre4">Just be discreet</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But diddle an account once, and I’m all his.” Jani
repocketed the thin plastic card. “He thinks.” If she put her mind to it, she
could divert half of Interior’s liquid assets into a float-rebound maze before
the Comptroller’s office had a chance to reconcile her first transaction.
Working with the Haárin had been an education in more ways than one. She
wouldn’t think of doing it, of course. But it was nice to know she could.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">When I’m good, I’m very, very good</i>. When she was bad,
she could make Lucien look like a stiff. Still, the ease with which she had
gotten around Ridgeway nagged her. But then, her idea of what constituted
“difficult” differed from most peoples’.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My Academy final exams were oral</i>. In High Laumrau.
Not one idomeni on the examining board, not even Nema, looked her in the face.
Instead, they watched her posture, her hands, the way she moved. Listened to
her tones, lilts, phrasings.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Pauses after her replies stretched for ten minutes or more,
then suddenly questions would pile on questions, with no chance of a request
for clarification being honored, or even acknowledged. The exam lasted for nine
humanish hours, with Jani knowing every step of the way that only one other
being in the room wanted her to succeed. And also knowing for that very reason,
he dare not make a move to help her in any way.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I learned as idomeni</i>. Which had made it damned
difficult to slip back into the humanish way of doing things. Back to the world
of subtext. Hidden meanings. Things left unsaid, glossed over. <i class="calibre4">The world
between the lines</i>, Hansen had called it. He’d been able to move between
idomeni and humanish without breaking a sweat, but there had been a very good
reason for keeping Jani off to one side. <i class="calibre4">A typical socially backward paper
pusher—I gabbled, and I blurted, and I explained too much</i>. To go from a
culture where everything you say is understood instantly to one where you could
talk for hours and not say a goddamned thing had rattled her. She had fit with
the idomeni so well, she thought.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Until I proved myself most human.” She sipped her coffee,
grown cold in the cup. <i class="calibre4">Too easy</i>. The coffee tasted greasy and harsh.
Jani flushed it down the sink and set out for the Library.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
It proved a happy accident that she ran into Angevin Wyle in
the journal reading room. She had been trying to figure out how to contact her
without using the Houseline or risking another encounter with Ridgeway.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hullo.” Angevin leafed without interest through a documents
journal. “What’s up?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I have some info for you.” Jani beckoned her toward a pair
of chairs in an isolated corner of the room. “About those sailracing lessons we
talked about. It’ll give you a chance to get out of here for an hour or so.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sailracing? I never—” Angevin lowered herself to the edge
of her seat. A flicker of life animated her pinched features. “What’s going
on?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I need you to contact someone outside Interior. You have to
do it from a public comport in the city. He’ll meet you to arrange the transfer
of some things he’s obtaining for me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why don’t you use the courier service?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Because I don’t trust the courier service</i>. Jani
debated the best handle by which to grip Angevin for this detail. “The Doc Control
administers the courier service, and I don’t want Durian to find out I had
contact with this guy. He works for Exterior.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Durian. Phfft!” Angevin cradled her chin in her hand. “Is
this guy good-looking?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Even better.” The young woman fluffed her mashed curls.
“Any particular place I should contact him from?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The only spot I know in the city is the mall with the
skating rink.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin wrinkled her nose. “That tacky place.” She rummaged
through her small shoulder bag, liberating a colorstick and a mirror. “I’ll
call him from the Galleria,” she said as she applied bright copper to her lips
with a few deft strokes. “What’s his name?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Lucien Pascal. He’s in Exterior Security.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Lucien</i>.” Angevin waggled her eyebrows. “Oo la la.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Blond. Brown eyes. Your age. As tall as Minister van
Reuter. Make sure to mention the sailracing—then he’ll know you came from me.”
Jani hid a smile behind her hand as Angevin applied the colorstick to her
cheeks as well. “I appreciate this.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah, well, I need a break. Supper meeting coming up. Then
I get to confer with Durian again.” Angevin crossed her eyes. “Speaking of
Durian,” she said nonchalantly as she continued to apply her makeup, “what are
you getting from this Lucien that might upset him?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani leaned back in her seat. Her battered shoulders
cramped. “Job-related things,” she replied through clenched teeth. “Just
stuff.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin dabbed at the corners of her mouth. “Things. Just
stuff. For the sake of my Registry standing, I don’t want to know the details, do
I?” She studied Jani over the top of her mirror. “Durian doesn’t like you. He
thinks you’re trouble. He told me, and I quote, ‘His Excellency has taken in a
stray who will turn on him,’ unquote. Durian tends to be melodramatic, but he
didn’t get where he is by being wrong a lot.” She tossed the mirror and
colorstick back in her bag. “Does this involve Lyssa van Reuter’s death?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I thought that had been ruled an accident,” Jani said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, we’re going to be that way, are we? Maybe I should beg
off and let you arrange your own damned transfer.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Please don’t</i>. If Angevin didn’t agree to help, Jani
knew she’d have a difficult time finding another runner. Steve and Betha
certainly wouldn’t oblige, which meant she’d have to pick a suitable stranger
and bribe him or her with nontraceable cash chits. And you could not get a
dummy chit from a Cabinet House bank booth, no matter how many <i class="calibre4">a</i>’s you
had on your expense voucher.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Assuming Lucien comes through with something worth paying
for</i>. Assuming he had anything to come through with. Courts of Inquiry
weren’t exactly known as fountains of useful information. Anything good had a
tendency to be kept in the Family. “Why do people wonder about Lyssa’s death?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin wandered to the window behind Jani’s seat and stared
into the winter darkness beyond the glass. “There were rumors.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That her death wasn’t an accident?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin nodded. “That it was murder. The big one for about a
month was that His Excellency finally got so fed up with her that he arranged a
mishap. When that led nowhere, everyone whispered about how much Anais Ulanova
and Lyssa’s mother hated one another over the mess with Lyssa’s father, and
that Anais waited until he died to murder Lyssa in revenge.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That hypothesis sounds bizarre enough to be popular,” Jani
said with a dry laugh. “Doesn’t jibe with the fact Lyssa worked for Auntie,
though.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How about the rumor Lyssa was really Anais’s daughter by
Scriabin.” Angevin’s lip curled. “Durian laughed till he cried when that one
started circulating.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sounds like one he’d start himself.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Doesn’t it, though?” The young woman’s tense face relaxed
in a grin. “Nice to know we have the same opinion of my boss.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So why work for him?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin shrugged. “Means to an end. Building the old Cabinet
pedigree.” She grew serious. “Last thing my dad would have done, according to
all who knew him. When that’s the case, sign me up.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh Hansen—maybe she doesn’t mean it</i>. Jani looked up
at Angevin’s somber face. Oops. Maybe she did, at that.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What type of man,” Angevin continued, “would leave his wife
and child behind in order to school in a place that didn’t want him and meddle
in things that didn’t concern him? That’s my mom’s slightly biased viewpoint.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What’s yours?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Every time someone who knew him sees me, they tell me how
much I look like him. Then they stand back with this shit-eating grin on their
face and wait for me to do my Hansen Wyle imitation.” Angevin tugged at a
flattened curl. “I don’t know what they want me to say. I don’t know what they
want me to do. I never knew him. I don’t remember him. To me, he’s a few holos
and a name in the first page of the Registry.” She looked down at Jani. “You’re
about the age he’d be now. You’ve lived out for years. Did you ever meet him?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani swallowed hard. “No.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I wonder if he’d have ever met anyone in secret to arrange
an iffy transfer?” Angevin shouldered her bag and moved away from the window.
“I have to go to my office and get my coat. Then I’ll be off.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani made an effort to elevate her dampened mood. “If I see
Steve,” she said, “do you want me to mention you’re going off to see another
man?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Steve can go to hell and take Betha Concannon with him,”
Angevin replied flatly as she strode out of the reading room.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Is that a</i> yes <i class="calibre4">or a</i> no? Jani lacked recent
experience in the Rules of War as they applied to battling lovers. <i class="calibre4">Maybe I’d
better mind my own business</i>. She wandered around the reading room, paged
through several journals, and arranged to have copies of technical updates sent
to her suite workstation.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, that used up a half hour.” She debated conducting a
search through Interior stacks, but doubted she’d uncover anything worthwhile
in any legally accessible areas. She needed to get her hands on locked-down
paper, documents that had been removed from public access. She didn’t dare try
that without Lucien’s jig. If she tried and failed to bull into a controlled
Cabinet system, the alarm would be raised. And if Ulanova discovered the
burrowing attempt originated from Interior . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We’ll wait for Angevin.” Jani limped along the convolve of
short halls and aisles leading from the reading room to the main body of the
Library. The technical dissertation section always proved the least visited
area of every bibliodrome she’d ever visited; Interior proved no exception. She
wandered down aisle after aisle of leather-bound dexxie theses, encountering no
one, checking the quality of the couches and chairs along the way. “Do what you
can when you can,” she said with a yawn as she stretched out in a particularly
comfortable lounge chair, “including nothing.” She worked her duffel beneath
her head to serve as a pillow and closed her eyes.
