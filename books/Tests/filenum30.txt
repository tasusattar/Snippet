<p class="NormalFirst">
Ridgeway joined Jani inside the parts-bin vending alcove;
they took turns draining the water cooler. Jani downed dispo after dispo in an
effort to assuage her relentless thirst, but Ridgeway just needed something to
wash down the multicolored tablets he tossed into his mouth like candy.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I recall your saying something about an emergency requiring
a body.” He popped a tiny yellow ovaloid Jani recognized as a black-market
tranquilizer. “Check that point off your list, Risa—requirement met.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Forell didn’t do it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’ve known him less than three days. I’ve dealt with him
for over a year.” Ridgeway made a vain attempt to brush his hair out of his
eyes. “Allow the fact I know my people, however little you think of my ability
to handle them.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Stick it</i>. Jani looked down the hall. One of the
Commonwealth Police officers had set up a dyetape barrier in front of the
carrel door. Two others had entered the small room carrying scanscreens and
evidence cases. A skimgurney hovered against the wall, its body bag zipped
open, waiting to be filled. “Steve’s feelings for Betha seemed almost
paternal,” she said. “I can’t accept that he’d turn on her.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway gave a tired shrug. “It wouldn’t be the first time
a mentor turned on his charge, Risa.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“True, but for a relationship like that to turn bad, it
needs an edge. The edge just wasn’t there. Substitute Angevin for Betha and you
for Steve—there’s a murder I could accept.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway scowled. “Dear, dear Angevin.” The black-and-grey
shades of his daysuit, combined with his pallor and mood, made him look like an
animated pencil sketch. “She chose her bed. Let her lie in it.” He reinserted
his nose plugs and stepped out of the alcove to take a look at the scene down
the hall. “Tell me, my esteemed enemy, would you really have shot me?” The
plugs made him sound nasal.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. Not with that weapon, not in an enclosed space.” Jani
considered stopping there, but with an esteemed enemy, one never held back
certain truths. “I would have clouted you alongside the head with the butt end,
though. But only if you became violent.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Thank you, Risa,” Ridgeway replied. “That makes me feel so
much better.” They walked down the aisle toward the dyetape barrier. “Are you
going to tell me what you were working on with those two? Besides the fact it
involved Lyssa.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ruining a reputation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh.” Ridgeway stepped close to the barrier, taking care to
avoid the trespass sensors and the splattering of marker dye that would follow.
“Anyone I know? Or should I say, knew?” He clasped his hands behind his back
and lifted his chin. All he needed was a blindfold and a nicstick to complete
the effect. “You’re going after Acton. The connection with Neumann. What he did
to Martin.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, hell!” One of the ComPol officers stationed outside the
carrel entrance turned to stare at them, and Ridgeway lowered his voice.
“Forget the scandal. Forget the political hay Ulanova would make of it. How can
you think of piling something like that on your Minister, atop all he’s been
through already?” Anger returned the familiar flush to his face. “Your
definition of loyalty appears as novel as your one for emergency. He’d have to
resign. In disgrace.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Have you looked at him lately! He’s killing himself,
Durian. It may be in a socially acceptable manner, but it’s suicide all the
same.” Jani watched the flickers of multicolored light reflect off the surface
of the open carrel door. That meant the forensic techs had set up their screens
and were scangraphing the body and the area around it. “Forced retirement could
save his life.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Or end it.” The fluttering light had drawn Ridgeway’s
attention as well. A muscle in his cheek twitched. “I saw him this morning. He
told me he asked you to quit your investigation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So what are you doing here?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I was brought in to do a job.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And now you’ve been asked to quit.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Tell me why I should.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Before Ridgeway could respond, Colonel Doyle emerged from
the carrel. Dyetape deactivator wand in hand, she poked and pushed toward them,
her expression grim.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Damn, damn, damn.” She massaged the back of her neck, but
rejected Ridgeway’s offer to share his tablet collection.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So?” he asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Manual strangulation. ME thinks she died around midnight.”
Doyle glanced at the cup in Jani’s hand. “I could use some water, Ms. Tyi.
Could you show me where it is, please?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
As soon as they reached the alcove, Doyle sagged against the
wall, sliding down until she crouched on the floor. “Her neck. You could hear
it crunch when the ME touched her chin. Then her head just flopped over. There
were hemorrhages under her eyelids. Lots of them. Whoever killed her tightened
down, then eased up and let her come to.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani filled a dispo with cold water. Doyle stared past her
when she held out the cup, and she set it on the floor in front of her.
“Torture strangulation. Whoever killed her was desperate for something she
knew. Or had.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t seem very surprised by this.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, not completely.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you think Forell did it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then who?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani moved to the other side of the alcove and sat on the
floor. “Both she and Steve were working to keep themselves out of jail under my
direction. Of the two, Betha seemed the more scared. I think she’d confided in
someone else without Steve’s knowledge. That person killed her.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle covered her face with her hands. She stared at Jani
through a cage of fingers. “Could you please back up to the ‘keep themselves
out of jail’ part, and explain what you mean by ‘direction’?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani wavered. Because the murder occurred on Cabinet
property, the ComPol had to work with House Security. If Steve turned up during
the search, Doyle would handle his transfer into their eager hands. “Deal?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What kind?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Stall the ComPol. Don’t tell them about Steve. If he turns
up, hang on to him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How! It’s a murder, Ms. Tyi. ComPol is setting up a command
center in my office as we speak!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He didn’t do it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“According to Durian, Forell had means, motive, and
opportunity.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’d listen to that jackass?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Murder makes me open-minded. Besides, if Forell is
innocent, he could be in danger as well. Jail may be the safest place for him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tried to shake her head, but the rocking motion made
her sick to her stomach. “I need him here,” she said. “He has special knowledge
of past events I’m investigating for His Excellency. Besides, imprisonment for
any reason means a mandatory hearing. Unless Steve’s able to build a good
defense, he faces immediate deletion from the Registry.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You goddamn dexxies are all alike, you know that!
Self-centered morons! Betha Concannon is <i class="calibre4">dead</i>. She died horribly. Steven
Forell can bundle his botched career with his scanpack and shove them both up
his ass!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m perfectly aware of how Betha died, Colonel. Do you want
the real murderer to go unpunished? What happened to your open mind?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle’s jaw worked. She picked up the dispo of water and
took a cautious sip. “What do you want?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Keep the ComPol away from Steve Forell. Give me two days.”
Jani waited for Doyle’s grudging nod before continuing. “Betha buggered paper
for Lyssa.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Durian mentioned that already. That angered Steve because
one bad colony kid ruins it for the others.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. Steve was trying to help Betha get out from under. He
knew what she’d done. We were digging into why Lyssa wanted the work done in
the first place.” Jani straightened slowly and moved to Doyle’s side of the
alcove so she could talk more softly. “Eighteen years ago, during the last
idomeni civil war, several ranking Family members made a deal with the Laumrau.
Protection and support in exchange for research involving personality
augmentation. Acton van Reuter used what he learned to have his grandson,
Martin, augied at the age of three.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle’s jaw dropped. “That’s what was wrong with that kid?
Oh God! You don’t augment someone that young—you create a monster.” Her
expression grew pained. “Five years ago. I had just begun working here. There
were several episodes we needed to hush up. One with his sister—” Her look
sharpened. “Did His Excellency and the Lady know?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I think Lyssa figured it out. I believe she had herself
augmented, perhaps so she could better understand what Martin went through.”
She thought back to Evan’s after-dinner confession. “Or perhaps, because of her
particular brain chemistry, she knew it would cause her to hallucinate under
stress. I think she saw what she wanted to see during those episodes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle winced. “Her kids?” She sighed when Jani nodded. “But
there have been rumors about Acton van Reuter’s dealings for years. He
prospered in spite of them.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Rumors are one thing. Betha had paper proof.” Jani
hesitated. “I’m pretty sure she had paper proof. Private documents from the van
Reuter library. The stuff Cao’s been trying to get her hands on for months.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle nodded. “I oversaw one transfer. A tense time was had
by all.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, the private paper is untouchable until Justice makes
a ruling, but if Nawar decides they’re actionable—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s the end of the <i class="calibre4">V</i> in NUVA-SCAN.” Doyle
crumpled the cup and tossed it into the trashzap, where it ignited with a soft <i class="calibre4">pop</i>.
“And Stevie knows what these papers consist of?” She smiled coldly at Jani’s
affirmative. “Then let’s go find Stevie.” She stood, then rubbed her knees
gingerly. “I remember my old CO telling me what a posh job House Security was.
If I ever run into her again, she’s in for one heavy-duty bout of reeducation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tried to stand, but her sore back balked. She held out
a hand to Doyle, who pulled her easily to her feet.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If what you say about Steve is true, Ms. Tyi, you’ve just
done me out of my prime suspect. Maybe I should add your name to the list, just
on general principles.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yours as well, Colonel. Anyone with a vested interest in
the status quo.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Good,” Doyle said as she stepped into the hall. “That
narrows down the list to mere thousands.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Two assistants from the ME’s office had just maneuvered the
skimgurney bearing Betha’s body into the hall. The colonel’s eyes locked on the
dull green body bag as it floated down the aisle and toward the elevators.
Ridgeway stood off to the side, conversing intently with a ComPol detective
lieutenant holding a recorder. Angevin, however, was nowhere to be seen. Jani
nudged Doyle. “Where’s Angevin?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Infirmary. Shock combined with the stench in this place.
First she was royally sick, then she fainted.” The gurney disappeared around a
corner, and Doyle turned back to Jani. “Were Steve and Betha having an affair?
I did hear rumors. Ms. Wyle’s temper is a minor legend around here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’ve seen Angevin’s hands. You saw Betha’s neck. Did they
match?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.” Doyle frowned. “The ME said it had to have been a man,
or a very physically fit woman.” Her grimace altered to a cool smile. “Like
you, Risa.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani smiled in return. “Or you, Virginia.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
They regarded one another until Doyle broke the impasse. “I
hate to sound petty, but this could not have come at a worse time. My Exterior
counterpart, Colonel Tanz, and his executive staff are coming over this
evening. Informal monthly meeting. My turn to pour tea and pass cookies.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani’s mind raced. Exterior. <i class="calibre4">The Court of Inquiry report</i>.
Would Lucien be a member of the executive staff? Could she pass off the report
to him under Doyle’s beady eye?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ve tried to cancel it these past two days, but Tanz
wouldn’t let me.” Doyle started down the hall. “‘Things we need to discuss,’ he
said, the son of a bitch. Knowing how quickly good news travels in this town,
I’m anticipating a lovely evening.” She offered Jani a tired wave before
disappearing around the corner.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway, his interview over, brushed past Jani without a
word. Then she felt a tap on her shoulder and turned to find herself fixed by
the dubious eye of a detective sergeant who just wanted to “ask a few
questions, please, ma’am.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani managed to escape with her pretenses intact. <i class="calibre4">Lying
to police—piece of cake—do it all the time</i>. The thought of cake made Jani
realize how starved she was. She ducked back into the alcove and built a late
breakfast from the offerings of the various machines.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">If one assumes Ridgeway lit a fire under ComPol’s
collective ass concerning Steve, Ginny’s going to have a hell of a time holding
them off</i>. Jani chewed thoughtfully. Two days of stonewalling could prove
impossible—one day could be pushing it. <i class="calibre4">Steve, where the hell are you</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She watched food wrappers flash to powder in the trashzap
and wondered if she’d soon be doing the same. <i class="calibre4">I saw Borgie clear as day.
Heard his voice</i>. It felt good to see him, in spite of the circumstances and
the intimation her health was deteriorating. Lyssa must have felt that way, as
well. Any contact, however fleeting, would serve in the never-ending quest to
ease the guilt-ridden ache.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
By the time Jani left the alcove, ComPol had finished
searching carrels. One lucky detective captain was donning a cartridge-filter
mask in preparation for searching the aquariums, where damaged scanpack innards
went to be rehabbed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Well, the aquariums were technically the most
visitor-friendly area of the bins. No static barriers to discharge. No
nitrogen-blanketing to recharge. <i class="calibre4">Just the open-top tanks with their little
baby brains</i>. The aquariums made the rest of the bin area smell like a
flower garden. Someone who chose to hide there did so in the hope no one would
look for them there. So, of course, ComPol would look there first.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Good luck, Captain—I give that mask twenty minutes, tops</i>.
Jani tried her Interior ID in the stairwell card reader. <i class="calibre4">Bet you burn your
uniform, too</i>. The access light blinked; the door swept aside. Either Doyle
had lowered the status of the lock-down, or Risa Tyi’s status was loftier than
Jani thought. She mounted the stairs, alert for movement of any kind. <i class="calibre4">Stevie,
where the hell are you</i>? Doyle certainly seemed concerned about finding him,
but she would have had him by now if she’d kept her eyes open outside the
cafeteria.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">If I were Ulanova, I’d want someone like Doyle in charge
of my enemy’s security</i>. Jani paused to consider the concept, then took the
steps two at a time until her cramping right hip told her to knock it off. The
fourth-floor door opened for her as had the third. She flashed her ID at a trio
of somber Security guards and studied wall maps until she found the corridor
that led to the infirmary.
