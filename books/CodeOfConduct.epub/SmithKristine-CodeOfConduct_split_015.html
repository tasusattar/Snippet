<p class="NormalFirst">
The “thank-you” Jani’s back gave her for spending the
night on her office floor was countered by the opinion expressed by her right
hip and thigh. She limped into the bathroom, shedding clothes along the way.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Another hot shower—two in less than a day. A giddy surfeit
of hydrodynamic riches. All wasted, unfortunately. Afterward, she only felt
battered and slightly feverish. Never had so much hot water done so little for
so few.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Travel lag. Had to be. <i class="calibre4">Over a month of artificial
gee—it’s never the same, no matter what they say</i>. She dug through drawers
and shelves, searching for an outfit that didn’t make her look like graveyard
shift in the engine room, finally settling on a dark blue trouser suit. The
color made her appear ill, but the cloth and cut of the outfit whispered
“expensive” with an Earthbound accent. She could wander Interior halls at will
in a getup like that. Besides, the trouser legs were cut wide enough to fit
over her boots.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani buttoned the roomy jacket, flexing her shoulders as she
checked herself in the full-length mirror. Keeping her hands in her pockets hid
the fact that the sleeves were uneven in length, with the right one too short.
She glumly examined the crooked breaks in her trouser cuffs. She looked all
right. Businesslike. Unconcerned with fashion, as though—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“As though I’d been hurled from a speeding skimmer.” She
tamped down her damp curls, vowed to check out the cosmetics selection in the
Interior stores, and gave the contents of her duffel a last check.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Just before she left, Jani glanced toward the comport light
on the end table by the bed. No blink, which meant no message from Evan. She
thought of Martin’s files, locked in her desk. <i class="calibre4">Yeah, I probably wouldn’t be
eager to talk to me, either</i>. Her stomach rumbled, and she tried to recall
the quickest route to Interior House Main. She’d take her meals there today.
However averse Evan was to seeing her, the feeling was mutual.
</p>

</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani had found the second-floor dining hall extremely
attractive the previous afternoon, which was why she avoided it now. Nobbies
were to be avoided at all costs. Ridgeway. Angevin. Even Steve.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She rode elevators and scaled stairs until the signs meant
nothing. DISPOSITION AND WAREHOUSING—FIELD ASSESSMENTS—CODES AND STATUTES. She
ducked into the first breakroom she came to, and was treated to a view of
skimmer charge lots and maintenance sheds through the single grimy window. She
grabbed a tray, loaded it with single-serve dispos from the glass-fronted
cooler and headed for the darkest corner of the deserted eating area.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Don’t forget to face the door</i>. Jani sat down, looking
up just in time to see Durian Ridgeway enter.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Good morning, Ms. Tyi.” He strode toward her, not seeming
at all surprised to find her in such a remote region of Interior Main. “Getting
to know the layout of the place, I see.” He was dressed in a black day suit and
white shirt that had the same effect on his complexion that Jani’s outfit had
on hers. He sat down across from her and started toying with the spice
dispenser.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’ve been following me,” Jani said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Strictly speaking, no. I just had people keeping an eye out
for you.” He frowned as she continued eating. “You certainly don’t seem the
worse for wear, considering.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Considering what?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You read Martin’s file, didn’t you? Evan gave it to you,
didn’t he?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, and yes, again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway’s ears reddened. “It’s too early in the morning for
flippancy, Ms. Tyi.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“On the contrary, Mr. Ridgeway, I am most serious.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then you agree with my estimation of the negative impact
the release of that information could have on his career?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway sat back with the edgy posture of one who knew
there had to be another shoe teetering on the brink somewhere. “Evan would like
to see you. After you finish your breakfast, of course.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani reached across the table and took the spice dispenser
from his hand. “He can kiss my ass.” She slid the spout around to the
white-pepper compartment and sprinkled some on her melon. “I’m not interested
in his explanations.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He’s your Minister, Ms. Tyi. When he says, ‘jump,’ it’s
your job to ask, ‘how high.’”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And yours to hold the measuring tape, Mr. Ridgeway. What a
valuable man you are.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway stared at her. Then his gaze flicked to her tray.
“Would you mind telling me why you just put pepper on your fruit?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Because that’s the way I choose to eat it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You know, Ms. Tyi, I don’t think you’re quite well.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shook the spice dispenser over her bowl until the melon
looked sand-dipped. “You can kiss my ass, too.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Spit and show me where, Risa dear,” Ridgeway replied
coolly. He turned toward the breakroom entrance. “Colonel Doyle. Could you come
in here please?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Three guards dressed in mainline winter polywools filled the
doorway like a steel blue eclipse in triplicate. A tall, rangy, dark-skinned
woman with a shaved head stepped forward, her eyes on Jani, one hand on her
shooter holster. “Sir?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway stood up. “It’s always been up to me to clean up
Evan’s little errors in judgment, Ms. Tyi. Perhaps you should keep that in the
back of what passes for your mind.” He tugged on his jacket cuffs. “Shall we
go?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked from Ridgeway, to the guards, then back again.
She knew she could get past them all and out of the room before any of them
knew what had hit them. Augie was telling her how. She would sustain damage, of
course, but she’d been damaged before. She wouldn’t die. She’d never die. She’d
tried it once. It didn’t take. <i class="calibre4">I could let them have it for you, Marty. Show
them what an augie can really do</i>. In the body of an adult who knew the
drill.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A sour burning rose in her throat as she stood. “You’ve left
me no choice, Mr. Ridgeway,” she said, ignoring his smug smile. As he turned
his back to her, her eyes locked on the place where his thin neck met his
undeveloped shoulder. <i class="calibre4">Perhaps later, Marty</i>. Who knew what could happen
later?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Outside, Jani excused herself and hurried to the nearby
lavatory, Ridgeway’s order to “hurry the hell up” ringing in her ears. She
reached the toilet just in time, losing her breakfast in a few rapid heaves.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
When she finished, she pressed her sweat-damp face against
cold ceramic, closed her eyes, and tried not to think how a thwarted augie
would take out his displeasure on a three-year-old boy. Or how the
three-year-old boy would react. It never paid to think along those lines. A
person could go crazy if she dwelled on things like that.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She cleaned up quickly, then rejoined her escort. Two of the
guards bookended her, while Doyle brought up the rear. Ridgeway, of course, led
the procession. Jani kept her eyes on the spot between his shoulder blades. The
point bobbed up and down—he had an annoyingly bouncy gait.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She slowly relaxed. She’d encountered her share of Ridgeways
in Rauta Shèràa, walked in more than one promenade to the principal’s office.
She shoved her hands in her pockets and swallowed down the last hint of bile.
She needed freedom and access to do the job asked of her. Despite what Ridgeway
wanted, Evan could only afford to bust her so far.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan waited for them in his office anteroom. Jani had to
allow him some credit—the look he gave Ridgeway and the guards would have
stopped a howling mob in its tracks. <i class="calibre4">It’s a gift—comes with the nose</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway held up a hand. “Evan, let me explain.” Pedantic
tone. Mistake.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“An armed escort,” Evan replied, very quietly. “Of my guest.
In my house.” Small “h.” Easily discerned. He’d chosen to take it personally.
He looked at Jani. “And what crime was committed?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway floundered. “She was insubordinate!” he finally
sputtered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan shrugged. “Of course she was, Durian. It’s part of her
charm.” He stepped past Ridgeway, who watched him with mouth agape and walked
over to Colonel Doyle, who seemed preoccupied with the pattern of the carpet.
“Virginia.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sir.” Doyle cast a sidelong glance at Jani and winced.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ms. Tyi is to be allowed free access to all parts of the
House.” Capital “H,” this time. “I was remiss in handling that. I’m taking care
of it now. You’ll help me see to it, won’t you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She is a professional, as are we all. Despite what you may
have been told, you have nothing to fear where she is concerned.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, sir.” Doyle looked at Jani again. In contrast to her
dark skin, her eyes were surprisingly light, a pale gold-brown. “If Ms. Tyi
will come by and see me afterward,” she said flatly, “I’ll see she’s taken care
of.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Of course.” Evan smiled. The temperature of the room rose
above subarctic. “Now, Risa and Durian and I need to talk.” He nodded toward
Colonel Doyle, who shot Jani a last, reappraising look as she herded her two
subordinates out of the anteroom.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway erupted as soon as the door closed. “How bloody
dare you! You made me look a fool!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You never needed any help from me in that regard!” Evan’s
voice shook. “We’re all three of us on one level from this point on. In it up
to our necks!” He spun on his heel. “We’ll talk in my office, where it’s
secure.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tried for a seat on the opposite side of the room from
Evan’s desk, but he blocked that move with a glare and gestured to a chair near
his own. Next to Ridgeway’s. Jani settled in and looked around. At least the
bar was closed up.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well?” Evan planted his elbows on his desk. He wore the
same sort of severely cut suit as did Ridgeway, but black was his color. It
enlivened his complexion, gave his slim frame a solidity it didn’t possess on
its own, and invested his anger with the authority of worlds.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Not a great way to start the day.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You already know my feelings.” Ridgeway jerked his head
toward Jani. “You’ll be sorry you brought her into this. Mark my words.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So you still decline to consider my side of things.” Evan
waved off Ridgeway’s protest and turned to Jani. “And are you, Ms. Tyi, sorry
you were brought into this?” A soft light filled his eyes. “You don’t look
pleased.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani teased at her right cuff. Try as she might, she
couldn’t pull it past her wrist. “Whose idea was it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan didn’t need to ask which idea. “Does it matter? I was
his father. It was my responsibility.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway chuffed in disgust. “Go ahead—play the martyr. If
you still think you can afford it.” He looked at Jani. It took an effort—she
could almost hear his spine crack from the tension. “It was Acton. He’d been
kicked out as king, so he tried for kingmaker. He’d heard about some
personality-enhancement work being done by researchers who’d broken off from
Neoclona. Similar to combat augmentation, though with a different focus.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan cut in. “The secessionists were making noise even then.
Nawar had just scrabbled his way back into power, won the interim election by a
landslide. The feeling at the time was that he’d be Prime Minister for life.
I’d taken the wrong side in a domestic appropriations dustup, so I was in the
political doghouse. Dad ran scared. He didn’t think he’d ever see a van Reuter
in the Cabinet again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani gave up on her jacket cuff and began tugging on her
pants. “Any Neoclona hack and slash will tell you augmentation is exactly that,
an enhancement of what’s already been formed. Whoever told your father they
could shape the personality of a three-year-old was a lying butcher, and he was
a fool to believe them.” A cold-blooded, megalomaniacal fool. But she herself
had been gouged more than once by the Old Hawk’s beak. “Did Lyssa know the
details?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We believe so.” Ridgeway and Evan answered simultaneously,
then Ridgeway picked up the ball. “She was a physician, after all. Not a
Neoclona affiliate but still well regarded. I’m sure she only suspected some
type of standard behavioral dysfunction at first, but when the true nature of
Martin’s problem became known, she plunged into denial as readily as the rest
of us. It began slowly. We thought it a phase, a bid for attention, especially
after Jerrold and Serena were born. We thought he’d grow out of it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani yanked on her right trouser leg—a high-pitched rip
sounded as lining gave way. “You—” She tried to count to ten, but lost track
after <i class="calibre4">three</i>. “You took an infant who had no true grasp of right or
wrong, no firm moral foundation, and engineered him to automatically, at all
times, put his own survival first above all things—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway’s face flared. “I had nothing to do with it—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—and you thought he’d grow out of it!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">You’re out of line, Tyi</i>!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stormed out of her chair, her stomach on fire. “<i class="calibre4">Kiss
my ass, you son of a bitch</i>!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan rushed around his desk and thrust an arm between them.
“<i class="calibre4">Quiet</i>!” He leaned hard against Jani, pushing her back into her chair. “I
don’t give a damn how you two feel about each other. When you are under this
roof, you will treat one another in a civil manner. You will not use any of my
departments like little toy armies in your vendettas,” he continued, catching
Ridgeway’s eye, “and, like it or not, you will work together. I need you both.
If I have to grind you both into one meaty lump and drag in Neoclona to make a
sensible person out of the mess, I will.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani fixed her eyes on the floor. She could hear Ridgeway’s
hard breathing slow.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan took his time returning to his seat. When he finally
spoke, Jani heard the smile in his voice. “I won’t ask you to shake hands. I’m
no physicist, but I understand the concept of fission.” His chair creaked. The
silence stretched.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
After what seemed hours, Jani looked up to find Ridgeway
staring at Evan, naked pleading paling his ruddy face.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Tell her, Durian.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, Christ, Ev—none of that can matter.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan looked at Jani, the shine in his eyes almost feverish.
Dying for a drink, probably, but he wouldn’t take one while she and Ridgeway
were there. “The fact is, Risa, my late wife was suborned by her unfortunately
not-late aunt to serve as an in-House verifier. How Ulanova managed to work
around Lyssa’s swan dives off the sobriety shuttle is anyone’s guess, but
Colonel Doyle and Durian uncovered evidence that, for the past several years,
my loving spouse kept Exterior well informed of the goings-on here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani pondered that kernel of information. <i class="calibre4">He kept that
from me because he knew if he told me, I wouldn’t have come</i>. “How much of
worth could Lyssa have revealed? You didn’t use her as counsel, did you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not per se. But I underestimated her influence, her access,
her—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Her hatred.” Ridgeway’s voice tremored. “She hated us all.
Blamed us all. Lyssa became expert at pointing fingers and slathering on guilt
with a trowel.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan pressed his thumb and forefinger to the bridge of his
nose. “Durian.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s true, Evan. No use denying it. She turned this House
into a civil-war-in-a-jar. God, the lies she told, the people she sucked in. We
had to purge entire divisions—we had Exterior-trained operatives running our
departments! To tell you the truth, Ms. Tyi, we still don’t know if we got
everyone.” His metal stare raked her. “We don’t know who could still be out
there, lurking.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani’s stomach rumbled. She pressed a hand to it to quiet
it. “I don’t recall any of this in the files you gave me, Mr. Ridgeway.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I gave you what I was told to give you. Information about
Evan.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Which was incomplete, as well.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.” He didn’t bother to explain or apologize. Those
points worked in his favor, since Jani would have believed neither. “But now,
it appears, the House is to be your oyster. Pry with care, Ms. Tyi. That’s all
I ask.” He rose. “I’ll ear-mark the files we’ve deemed most noteworthy,
although you’ll want to see them all, I’m sure. Have you ever investigated a
death?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.” <i class="calibre4">Not officially</i>. “I’ve stuck with paper crimes.”
The memories of her Service work nestled under Jani’s ribs, a bundle of warmth.
Or maybe it was heartburn? “Just show me the paper—I’ll take it from there. And
if I need your help, Mr. Ridgeway—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You will have it, of course. Make an appointment to meet
with me this afternoon,” he said as he swept out.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan’s groan rattled as the door closed. “It’s going to take
me days to settle him down. But it will have been worth it. He doesn’t like
you, but he will work with you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stared at the closed door. “He thinks I’m an Exterior
plant. Any slip I make, he’s going to magnify tenfold.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Who’s he going to bitch to? I’ll take it all with a
transport-load of salt. Virginia and the other execs will take their lead from
me.” Evan grinned. The years fell away. “He’s just jealous, anyway. Do you know
what he told me? He suspects you’re my mistress, on top of everything else.
Thinks I’ve been keeping you under wraps for years.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why would he think that?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Because I look so ‘contented,’ as he put it. That makes him
nervous. He likes hungry leaders. In case of a feeding frenzy, he’s guaranteed
a pile of scraps.” His smile wavered. “He saved my life, Jani. When all this
hit the fan, I knew I could count on him. I know what he is, what he wants. But
there were times when he could’ve hopped the fence with the others who followed
Lyssa, and he didn’t. Durian’s thrown in with me for better or worse. That’s
more than anyone else has ever done.” He looked at her. “Of course, you would
have stuck, if I’d given you the chance. But I listened to <i class="calibre4">him</i>.” Acton
van Reuter’s name, unspoken, hung heavy between them. “He chose Lyssa for me.
Shows what he knew.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked toward the balcony. The sun battered through the
glass—even from where she sat, she could feel the heat. She’d wanted to
throttle Evan only minutes before. Now a part of her just wanted to sit with
him, look out at the sun-shine, listen to his assurances.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
And fight back the other part of her that didn’t believe a
word of it. <i class="calibre4">Steve didn’t like Lyssa</i>. He hadn’t admitted it at dinner,
but the assumption made sense considering his evasion of Jani’s repeated
questions. Had Lyssa asked him to assist her in her illegal fact gathering? Had
he turned her down?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Had he?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan sat up with a start. “I’m actually at loose ends
tonight. How about dinner, back at Private? I’ll have cook do something
colonial.” He looked at her hopefully. “About seven?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Won’t that upset Durian?” Jani stood and tried to readjust
her ill-fitting jacket
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Screw him—I’m entitled.” He rose and walked around his
desk.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I think I can make it.” Jani tensed as Evan closed in and
slipped his arm around her waist. <i class="calibre4">Like it never left</i>. “Saw your speech
last night. I’m surprised Ulanova let you make it home alive.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She tried to buy me off. If I threw in with her publicly on
the secession-rights issue, she’d disband the Court. Problem is, I didn’t trust
her to keep her word. I also believe she’s wrong.” Evan opened the door for
her, looking out to see whether his staff had arrived. “Seven o’clock, then.”
He pulled his arm away as voices drifted toward them. “Considering what else
you’ve learned, I’m happy you’re still talking to me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I didn’t think I would be,” Jani admitted. “The fact your
father was involved explained a lot, though.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Explained my rolling over and playing dead, you mean.” He
eyed her guiltily. “What Lyssa did doesn’t seem to bother you as much.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Vengeful behavior, I’m more familiar with. I understand her
feelings. With her training, she could guess what Martin went through.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Anything like what you’ve gone through?” Evan asked softly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not the same thing, Ev. I could adjust.” She gave her
duffel an absent pat, as though it were an overlarge worry bead. “When did you
know?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Looking back, I’d say the signs were there from the start.
I just didn’t want to face it. I think I even know the day it happened. Dad
dropped by out of the blue and took Martin out for ice cream. I’ve never been
able to track where the actual implantation was done, though.” Evan slipped
back into his office and waved to a pair of uniformed clerks who entered the
anteroom. “Dad said Martin needed help. Right away, too, before things got out
of hand. My son had shown signs of taking after me, you see. Dad always felt I
lacked a sense of purpose, just because it wasn’t the same as his.” He gave
Jani a last, sad smile. “Seven o’clock,” he mouthed as he closed the door.
