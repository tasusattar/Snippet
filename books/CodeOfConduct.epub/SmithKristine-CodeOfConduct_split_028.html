<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_36">Chapter 23</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
The skimmer shuddered as it skirted the border between
Exterior and Shèrá property and ran afoul of both sets of tracking arrays.
Tsecha countered by applying the barest twitch to the vehicle’s controls,
redirecting it back within the Exterior domain. The skimmer’s agitation,
brought on by the confounding signals of two different systems, ceased
immediately.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha’s trembling, however, continued for some time. <i class="calibre4">This
godless cold</i>. Rolling whiteness stretched about him in every direction save
the east, where the lake-defining blackness stopped it short.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He searched the approaching darkness for the flicker of
Security vehicle illumins. Ulanova’s. His own. It made no difference—both would
be as enemy to him. He felt for the Haárin-made shooter, a souvenir of his war,
nestled in the chest pocket of his coat. <i class="calibre4">However, I cannot shoot at them</i>.
Such would constitute an incident.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So long, since I have taken part in an incident.” Tsecha
bared his teeth fully in the dimness of the skimmer cabin, then almost lost
control of his vehicle as the expression degenerated into a jaw-flexing yawn.
He had done much since his return from the play, little of which would have
received sanction from either his Temple or his Oligarch.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He slowed as he approached the Exterior outpost, activating
his black box at the same time. The device, also of Haárin origin, blocked the
automated concrete booth’s scanning equipment and prevented its outside alarms
from activating. It also took the extra step of misleading the scanners,
assuring them they were not being interfered with at all.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The only drawback to the ingenious device lay in the fact
the designers believed they understood humanish systems much better than they
actually did. The resulting errors in the interference program meant Tsecha had
only a very short time to do that which he came to do.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Three humanish minutes, in fact, beginning from the time he
first activated the unit.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
On average.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">So cold</i>! He half jumped, half slid from the skimmer
cockpit to the thermacrete slab on which the outpost rested, grunting in relief
as his boots struck dry deck. The thermacrete had apparently done its job in
preventing any snow from building up around the outpost, but Tsecha still
stepped carefully in the pitch-darkness. Heat cells did occasionally fail.
Failure here meant ice patches. Padding and shock absorption worked well for
youngish, perhaps, but he did not trust them to protect his old bones.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Besides, if he did fall, who would rescue him? <i class="calibre4">Cats and
police</i>, his Hansen had said, <i class="calibre4">only come when you</i> don’t <i class="calibre4">want them</i>.
Tsecha tapped the toe of his boot against the thermacrete, planting his foot
only when he felt certain he would not slip. <i class="calibre4">Tap, step, tap, step</i>—like
the odd, rapid gait of a shorebird, and truly. But he could not fall. He had
come too far to risk any mistake.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The door slid partially open. Illumins activated to the
dimmest setting. Once inside the windowless concrete booth, Tsecha hurried to
the small, plastic-covered bench that served as the supplies bin, cracking the
lock with a soundkey that also had been made by Haárin. <i class="calibre4">What would Vynshàrau
have done without our most excellent Haárin</i>? He pulled the large tool pouch
containing his humanish clothes from the recesses of his oversize coat, but
before he laid his bundled disguise to rest, he rummaged through the cluttered
bin.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Ah</i>! It lay beneath the first layer of half-empty parts
kits and battered all-weather gear. Most easy to find if you knew to look for
it, knew from repeated visits the position of every object in the bin. A
crumpled note. Tattered stone-colored parchment trimmed in dark Exterior red. <i class="calibre4">My
Lieutenant. My new friend</i>. Tsecha stuffed the note inside his coat, worked
his tool pouch to the bottom of the bin, relocked the lid, and hurried outside.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The outpost’s proximity alarm illumins fluttered to
half-life just as Tsecha threw himself into his skimmer, dying to dark as soon
as he jerked the vehicle back within its boundary. He flitted along the border,
hopped a pile of construction debris, then banked around a broad stand of
winter-bare trees. The embassy appeared, its lakeside face, sheltered from the
sight of godless humanish habits, enhanced by large windows, balconies, and
enclosed patios.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha could see no idomeni in any of the windows, but that,
of course, did not mean they could not see his skimmer. Not that they would
take special notice if they did. The vehicle, after all, belonged to Exterior,
and traveled along Ulanova’s side of the border.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha eased back on the accelerator as he approached the
Exterior maintenance shed located so conveniently close to his embassy. He
coaxed the skimmer into its charge slot with finesse acquired through
repetition, then fled across the border at the place his black box told him he
could pass unnoticed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha returned to his rooms by way of back stairways and
little-used passages, Lucien’s note resting like something burning against his
chest. Not since the war had he felt so. Then, every communication held life
and death between its lines. For himself. For his valued friends. And even for
a few esteemed enemies, without whose presence everyday life would have become
a desolation indeed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My Lucien thinks I play at a game, I think</i>. Tsecha
sneaked into his front room and immediately began peeling away his protective
clothing. Then he hurried to his favored chair, the crumpled paper clasped in
his hand. On the way, he hesitated, detoured to his worktable, and recovered
his handheld from its recess. What if, as Hansen before him, Lucien took it as
his godly duty to instruct an idomeni in the nuances of English?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I will need to study this note as I do my files</i>.
Tsecha unfolded the Exterior parchment, and stared. What had he expected? An
offer of an excursion? A suggestion of how to better pass himself off as
humanish? A simple greeting?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He saw nothing like that.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Instead, Tsecha read his language. <i class="calibre4">His</i> language, in
all its complexity, High Vynshàrau as his Sànalàn might compose if she were
male and member of a military skein.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
And the words. The phrases. The fear in the lines. Only
during the war had he read such, when his sect-sharers had watched Rauta Shèràa
from the hills above and Hansen pleaded with him that their time to act had
grown most short.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
. . . <i class="calibre4">get her out . . . am
meeting with her “captors” tomorrow evening . . . I can only get
her so far . . . am depending on you</i> . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha’s grip on the note weakened and it fluttered to the
bare floor. Such familiar words. So did Hansen plan his meeting with John
Shroud. <i class="calibre4">But my Hansen died</i>, on the morning of his meeting day. Most
sorry were the Haárin, to have bombed a building containing humanish. But then,
the humanish had left their untouchable enclave of their own free will,
choosing to interfere in idomeni affairs. Thus they were no longer blameless in
any of this, were they? The chief propitiator’s Eyes and Ears had herself set
the precedent. That being the case, where lay the disorder, or the blame?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But the Haárin, with their love of disorder, would feel that
way, would they not? The members of the Vynshà Temple, positioning themselves
for their ascension to <i class="calibre4">rau</i>, felt quite differently. They had seen how
the godless events of Knevçet Shèràa had demoralized the Laumrau. While they
had most willingly taken advantage of their foes’ disorientation, such did not
mean they wished to chance the same happening to them.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha felt a tightening in his soul. <i class="calibre4">They told me
Hansen’s death rediscovered order, Kilian’s death resuscitated order, while my
death</i>—he bent to pick up the fallen note—<i class="calibre4">my death would confirm order
had truly returned</i>. But he had talked them out of killing him, just as he
had earlier talked them into allowing humanish into their cities and schools.
The gods had gifted him with the power to persuade. They had allowed him the
wit to know when to take action and how.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
And they had provided him patience, so he could wait so long
for his Captain to return to him and not go mad.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha glanced at the timepiece on his worktable. <i class="calibre4">What do
you do now, John</i>? The city where the man worked—Seattle—was located far
west. That meant it was darker there, the middle of night. <i class="calibre4">Do you sleep,
John, or do you work</i>? He walked across the room to his comport and keyed in
a code any humanish with a Chicago city directory could find.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The face of a young, dark-haired male filled the display.
“Neoclona Chicago. May I help—” His eyes widened as he realized whose face
filled his display. Tsecha bared his teeth to alleviate his alarm, but the
action only seemed to heighten his agitation. “May—m-may—oh shit!” The stricken
face dissolved from the screen, leaving Tsecha to stare at nothing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Humanish see bared teeth as reassurance. Hansen said so</i>.
Tsecha tried to key in the code of another Neoclona department, but the idiot
youngish had activated some sort of lock which made such impossible. Too much
time passed as Tsecha tried every code combination of which he could think to
break the connection. <i class="calibre4">I cannot ask the communications skein for help—then
all will know to whom I spoke</i>. He made ready to remove the unit’s cover and
disconnect its power source in an effort to reset the system. It could damage
his unit beyond repair; if his Security had their way, he would not soon
receive another. The risk was considerable, but he didn’t know what else to do.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Just as he prepared to unclip the display screen from its
support, it returned to life with a flash. This male as well, he had never
seen. Pleasantly dark, with the facial hair many humanish males grew so easily,
clipped to a sharp point at the end of the chin. “NìRau,” the man said in a
pleasant voice, “John warned me you might call.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I must speak with him,” Tsecha said. “Whoever you are, tell
him he is to talk with me!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My name is Calvin Montoya, nìRau, and I’m a physician, like
John. He has given me some instructions, which he recently gave the heads of
all the major Neoclona facilities on Earth.” He fingered the hair on his chin.
“If you try to contact him through us, we are to tell you to go to hell. If you
have any doubts as to what we are saying, John has told us to tell you to, and
this is a direct quote, ‘Use your goddamn handheld.’ That is the message I am
supposed to give you, nìRau. I am then supposed to end the call and report the
attempted contact to John immediately.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha sat back in his chair, nodding as the man spoke.
Quite a clear communication. Most as idomeni, and most unlike Physician Shroud.
“Albino John may have given you meaning,” he said to the face on the screen,
“but Val Parini, I believe and truly, has given you the words. Physician Parini
always enjoyed speaking as idomeni. He thought himself most shocking to other
humanish as he did so. I am to guess from this he has been called back from vacation?
Please greet him for me when next you report to him.” Then, to ensure all would
be taken well, Tsecha ended by baring his teeth.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Unlike the youngish, Physician Montoya maintained his
composure, and even bared his teeth in return. “Alb—John warned me about you,
nìRau. Something along the lines of, ‘Don’t let him get a goddamn foot in the
door, or he’ll walk out with half the goddamn facility.’ I believe I understand
his concern.” He pushed a hand through his hair. “Now I am supposed to end this
call, or John will be angry.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“John is a stern dominant, Calvin?” Tsecha always sought to
call humanish by their primary names as soon as he learned them. Such a simple
act, but it seemed to make them so happy. And cooperative.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, nìRau, and I do like my job.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Yes, but you do not wish to end this call, because you
are curious</i>. “And what did Physician DeVries suggest you should do if I
contacted you, Calvin?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The physician’s brows arched. He laughed. “Ooh boy—John
warned us about the charm, too.” He jerked his shoulders, a gesture that could
have meant anything, and thus helped Tsecha not at all. “Actually, nìRau, what
Eamon suggested involved tracking your comport signal to its source, then
dropping shatterboxes until only a rubble-filled crater remained.” Calvin’s
smile disappeared. “I believe he was joking.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Left hand clenched, Tsecha gestured in the extreme negative.
“And I know he was not. Your John and your Val, I believe, accepted Eamon into
their skein for his technical expertise, not his social.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Calvin coughed. “I really have to disconnect now, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You must tell John—you <i class="calibre4">must</i> tell him I am most
concerned!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Calvin grew very still. At first, Tsecha thought the display
had malfunctioned. “Your concerns are noted, nìRau. And they are being
explored. Now, I must go.” He disconnected before Tsecha could again speak.
Most wise, actually. Given more time, bearded Calvin would surely have told him
everything he wanted to know.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">It is how primary names affect these walls. So desperate
are they for order, they interpret such as understanding</i>. Tsecha slumped
back in his chair. <i class="calibre4">But I understand so little</i>. Throughout his wing of
the embassy, the tonal series that signaled time for early-morning sacrament
sounded. He rose and listened for the preparatory scrapes and clattering which
indicated the presence of his cook-priest and her suborn in his altar room.
Tsecha waited until the blessed red illumin flickered above the altar-room
door, meaning the room was fit for him to enter.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The meal did not go well. Tsecha ate his grains and fruits
in the wrong order, forgot to spice his meats, lost track of his prayers. <i class="calibre4">Your
concerns are being explored</i>. Hansen had often told him how humanish
explored one another’s concerns. <i class="calibre4">The more they claim they do, the less they
truly do. It is a well-established fact with our species</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But he tells me my concerns are being explored, Hansen</i>.
Tsecha withdrew from his altar room and headed to his favored enclosed patio.
It viewed the lake, as did they all, but if one squinted, one could also catch
a glimpse of the Interior compound far down the shore. He had often done so, in
days past, when he considered the soul of Acton van Reuter and where it might
currently reside.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But now Tsecha stood in his enclosure, watched the illumins
far down the beach, and considered Acton’s son. <i class="calibre4">He and my Captain—a most
seemly pairing</i>. Or so it had appeared at the time. <i class="calibre4">But the father
forbade it, and now the father is dead</i>. His Lucien’s words returned to him.
<i class="calibre4">She hides in plain sight, nìRau</i>. And his Calvin’s words. <i class="calibre4">Your
concerns are being explored</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Plain sight!” Tsecha hurried from the patio to the comport
booths located within the documents repository. No reason to obscure the fact
of this call. This call was indeed most seemly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha entered the code for Interior House. The young female
whose face appeared on the display also maintained her composure—she had spoken
with him before.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Angevin Wyle, please, Sandra.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The female bared her teeth, as Tsecha knew she would, and
directed her attention to her House console. Her expression waned. “Ms. Wyle is
unavailable, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do not summon her in her office—she is not there yet.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, nìRau, I buzzed her residence. She’s not home.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where is she?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She’s left no forwarding code, nìRau.” Sandra shrugged.
Humanish, in Tsecha’s opinion, shrugged too much. “I can leave her a message,
if you wish?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. No.” He could not wait for messages. Another humanish
came to mind. Male, this one. Slumped as the Oligarch. Red hair, though not as
godly as Hansen’s daughter’s. “Steve!” he shouted.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Mr. Forell in Xeno?” Sandra applied herself to her console.
“I know he won’t be in at this hour.” The female’s eyebrows rose. “His private
code is blocked, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Blocked?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Blocked, nìRau.” Yet another strange expression crossed the
female’s face. Something as a smile, and yet . . . “It means
he’s home, but doesn’t wish to be disturbed.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ah.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I can message them both, nìRau.” Sandra’s brow now lowered.
That meant confusion. Sometimes. “Are you sure you don’t want to speak to the
head of Xeno? Perhaps His Excellency himself?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, Sandra. Message Angevin Wyle please.” He ended the call
and returned to his rooms to dress for his appointments. <i class="calibre4">Today I see the
Prime Minister, who will complain of my treatment of Detmers-Neumann, and a
delegation from the Xhà Pathen, who will complain of my favoritism toward their
brethren the laes</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Both complaints held truth, of course. <i class="calibre4">I treat
Detmers-Neumann as she deserves and the Xhà as they deserve, and for much the
same reason</i>. Tsecha secured the privacy locks to his sanitary room. <i class="calibre4">I do
not trust them</i>. He removed the overrobe and trousers he had donned for his
excursion to the maintenance shed and prepared to lave. His scars glistened
pale in the overhead illumination—he stared at them in his reflection and felt every
blade slice him anew. His meal rested as a weight in his stomach, his knees
ached from the leap he had made onto the thermacrete, and if John Shroud had,
by some godish whimsy, appeared before him at that moment, he would with great
joy have snapped the man’s neck.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My Lucien knew where she was and did not tell me</i>. His
odd Lucien, who enjoyed disorder. Tsecha plunged his arms to his elbows in hot
water, felt its steam condense upon and trickle down his face. <i class="calibre4">I must save
her</i>. His Captain. With his odd Lucien’s aid. And he would bury all who
tried to stop him, as the Haárin had buried his Hansen.
</p>
