<p class="NormalFirst">
“Where are you taking me?” Jani lagged behind Lucien as he
led her through the garage. She swore under her breath as she searched for an
escape route.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My skim’s charging. I’m just behind that,” he said as he
pointed to the silver-and-purple ambulance that jutted through a low arch like
a metallic tongue. “I hope to hell I can pull around.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Where are you taking me</i>!” Jani’s voice bounced off
the cement walls. Her eyes teared freely, both junctions ached, the drying skin
of her right arm tingled and itched, and Dr. Montoya’s enzyme tablets had left
a sickening metallic taste in her mouth. Oh, and there was the fear. Fear did
wonders in countering take-down malaise. Jani planted in the middle of the garage,
her hands curled into fists. “I’m not budging until you tell me where we’re
going.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien turned back to her, his handsome face a study in
angel innocence, his hand resting possessively on her duffel. “We’re going over
there,” he said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani squinted in the direction he pointed, trying to pick
out details in the dark. A battered sedan nestled in a charge station, but the
flow monitor atop the station’s housing shone blue, indicating the vehicle’s
cell array was already fully charged.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Dark red. The vehicle’s color was dark red. An old Exterior
skimmer. Jani’s stomach roiled as the driver’s side gullwing popped up.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I tried to talk him into stepping up to a better class of
vehicle,” Lucien said, “but he seems to have taken a shine to that old wreck,
color and all.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Nema emerged from the vehicle like poured syrup and stepped
into the light. He had left his humanish evening suit behind, opting for the
Vynshàrau clothing of an elder male of his skein and station. Full-sleeved,
off-white shirt tucked into loose, light brown trousers. Dark brown knee-high
boots. Wide bands of scarlet hemmed the edges of his cream overrobe. His thin,
silver brown hair had been gathered into a single braid and looped like an
oversize earring on the right side of his head.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My Captain,” he said in English, his High Vynshàrau accent
softening the hard sounds. “I thought I would need Albino John’s help to
identify you, but to my joy I find you most as yourself. Glories of the day to
you.” He bared his teeth fully, an expression of highest regard. His bony face
seemed to split, gold eyes opening wide. Grim Death with a Deal for You.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau ti nìRau.” Jani stood up straight despite the
stinging pain in her thigh junction and crossed her left arm over her chest,
palm twisted outward. She tilted her head to the left. Nodded once. Thank God
for the mechanics. If you could concentrate on the mechanics, you could block
out everything else. She glanced to the side and saw Lucien watching her like
an anthro student on his first field trip. “Push off,” she said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t think so.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Go, Lucien,” Nema said. “I wish it as well.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, nìRau. I have my orders.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Which were to guard. So guard out there.” He gestured
sharply toward the garage’s entrance. “There is no need for guards here.” He
looked Jani in the eye and bared his teeth again. “My nìa and I are most safe
with one another, and together, we win against all.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien took a step in Nema’s direction, ready to argue. But
when Nema refused to look at him, he turned on his heel and strode out of the
garage.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani waited until the echo of his footsteps died away.
“You’ve hurt his feelings,” she said in semiformal High Vynshàrau, etching
fluid symbols in her air with her right hand. Her gestures accentuated the
humiliation of a suborn cruelly mistreated by his dominant. “He is new to the
ways of Vynshàrau, and he is not predictable. He might do something to hurt you
in return.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Perhaps,” Nema replied, the angle of his head implying
tentative agreement, “but then he will find I am not so predictable as well.”
He shook his head, humanish urgency leaching into his speech and gestures.
“There is no time for him. Ulanova searches for you, nìa! She knows you are
here in this damned cold city!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She wants to see me court-martialed that badly?” Jani
glanced toward the garage entrance. She trusted Lucien. In this particular
instance. Really. She just wished she’d had the presence of mind to ask him for
her duffel.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Nema flicked his left hand in affirmation. “Eventually, I am
most sure. My injured Lucien believes she first would force you to testify in
Cabinet Court against van Reuter. The trial would be broadcast throughout the
Commonwealth. Such a triumph for my Anais.” His brow wrinkled in bafflement.
“She hates van Reuter so. Lucien tried to explain it to me, but I could not
understand. Things to do with business and your ways of marriage, among so many
other stupid things. Such ridiculous disorder, inappropriate for dominants of
their levels, and truly.” He sighed. “So much I do not understand, and no one
is to be left to me to explain.” He looked Jani in the face and his posture
grew somber. “Step closer to me, nìa, so I can see you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani edged nearer, fighting down the urge to bolt back
inside the hospital. When Nema grasped her chin and tilted it upward, her eyes
stung and her throat ached.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You have not changed, nìa.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I look completely different to humanish.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Humanish only look at the face. I see the gestures and hear
the voice of one who is most as she was.” Nema’s amber eyes glittered like
molten metal as he studied her. “I would have spoken with you in your hospital,
after your damned transport explosion, but John would not let me. He hid you
away, when I could have sheltered you better. He behaved in a most stupid
manner.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He had his reasons, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, stupid humanish reasons. Did you choose him freely?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes. No.” Jani pulled Nema’s hand away from her chin. “I
thought he’d turn me over to the military police if I didn’t. By the time I
realized he never would have done that, it was too late. The Haárin had entered
the city, the humanish were fleeing—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And he, your physician, did not see you safe!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I never gave him the chance, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Nema took a step back from her, touching the side of his
face in a way Jani couldn’t interpret. For the first time she could recall, her
teacher appeared at a loss for words. “You must go soon,” he finally said in
English, his speech stripped of gesture. “Lucien has found a ship which will
take you as far as Felix. I do not know how he found it. He tried to explain it
to me, but I could not understand! It is not as it was with you. My Eyes and
Ears. When you saw and heard, it was as if I myself saw and heard.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You had Hansen.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hansen was Hansen. He taught me games—he was not you. And
now I have found you after so much time, and you must run again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani took a deep breath. “I killed, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.” Nema tucked his hands into his sleeves. “You killed.
In that way, as well, you are most as you were.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I did what I did.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, nìa. We all do what we do.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She stared into her teacher’s eyes, felt adrift in a sea of
gold. “I’d do it again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes. Your own did not know you for what you are. The
Laumrau believed your own, and see how they paid.” Nema’s attitude grew
distant, as though he questioned her for an exam. “You have recovered from your
injuries most rapidly, I understand?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani nodded, addled by his presence and the abrupt change in
subject. “Yes, nìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Your Dr. Mon-toy-a, he is confused. Albino John is not so
confused, I think.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I wouldn’t know, but—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And you, nìa, are not confused at all.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We’re not at Academy anymore, nìRau. We don’t have time for
philosophies.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha gestured sadly. “No, you are most right, nìa. The
time for philosophies has passed us both.” He fell silent, staring at her
impassively. Then he pulled his hand from his sleeve. Held the closed fist out
to her. Opened it. “Now is the time for realities.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her Academy ring rested within. The jasperite glinted like
the eye of a night creature.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Inshah</i>,” Jani said, addressing Nema with the
informal High word for teacher, “you’re wrong.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Wrong?” Nema’s brow wrinkled as he considered the concept.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m not the one you want. Hansen would have been, maybe,
but not me. I’m too disorderly.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha nodded, gesturing in strong affirmation. “You are
toxin, Captain. You bring pain and change. Such is your way. You know no
other.” He reached for her right hand and placed the ring on her third finger.
It was still too small—metal scraped over skin as he forced it into place.
“Still some time yet, I think. But soon. Soon.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m not your heir, nìRau. You’ve made a mistake.” Jani
sensed motion out of the corner of her eye and turned to find Lucien standing
in the garage entry. He tapped his timepiece. “I have to go,” she said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Nema looked at Lucien and sighed. “Yes.” He turned back to
Jani and stood straighter. “But someday, when you have not killed for a time,
you will come back to me. Then we can argue your suitability.” His lips curved.
It wasn’t an idomeni expression of goodwill—he didn’t bare his teeth a
millimeter, or even cock his head. It was a humanish smile, the smile of
someone who knew better. “<i class="calibre4">a lète onae vèste, Kièrshi-arauta</i>,” he said as
he gestured farewell to her, left hand extended, palm facing up. A farewell to
an equal. Then he slipped back into his skimmer. The vehicle came to life with
a smooth hum, then flitted away from its station and out of the garage like a
bedraggled bat.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
It took Jani a moment to realize she was shaking.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien drew up beside her and handed her her duffel. “He
drives like a maniac,” he said, still smarting from his abrupt dismissal. “Not
much for good-byes, either.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No,” Jani agreed, “none of the Vynshàrau are. They each
live in their own little world. Nema figures if he likes you, you’ll come to
him again, and if he doesn’t, why should he care?” She tried to fluff her
pillow-mashed hair, then tugged at her medwhites in distaste. “Trade ya
clothes,” she said, eyeing Lucien’s warm polywools with envy.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ve got some for you in the skimmer.” He headed toward his
charge slot. “We better get going—your shuttle leaves in an hour.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani fell in quietly behind Lucien, noting with interest
that he now drove a stolid blue sedan. “New skim?” she asked, as they drifted
sedately into busy late-afternoon traffic.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It does what it has to. It’s also less conspicuous and
loaded with antitracking.” Lucien frowned at Jani as he maneuvered between
lanes. “Yes, I had to give the other one back to Anais. Happy?” He reached
behind her seat. “Here,” he said, tossing a bundle of clothes in her lap.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Who sideswiped your face?” Jani asked as she pulled a heavy
shirt over the medwhite top. Service surplus winterweight fatigues, baggy and
dark blue. Her kind of clothes. “Anais or Claire?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien touched his injured cheek. “None of your business.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Be that way. Are we going to O’Hare?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. A private port.” He unsnapped the top of his shooter
holster as he eyed the traffic flowing around them.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tugged on her heavy trousers. “How are Steve and
Angevin?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Forell was locked up for a day and a half. Unfortunately,
they found the code. Ange rousted some of her dad’s old Academy chums. Your old
chums as well, I suppose. They twisted arms. You could hear the sockets pop all
down Cabinet Row.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I would liked to have seen them before I left.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not an option. I’ll tell them good-bye for you.” Without
warning, Lucien cut across five lanes of traffic and shot down an exit ramp.
Jani took a few deep breaths to slow her heart, but kept her comments to
herself. She knew the difference between reckless and evasive driving.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Montoya told me you ignored the news,” he said as he
maneuvered down a side road. “No mention of Betha. Lyssa’s death is still
considered an accident.” He paused. “Ridgeway’s death has been ruled a
suicide.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I broke his neck,” Jani said as she pulled off the
med-shoes. “Wonder how the medical examiner explained that?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien shrugged. “It’s Chicago. Precedent exists.” He nodded
toward the bag, which he’d tossed on the floor at Jani’s feet. “Your boots are
in your duffel.” He stared at the side of her face until she gave in and looked
at him. “I don’t know why you should feel bad,” he said. “He would have killed
you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s just post take-down.” Jani stared out the window at
the passing scenery. “Look, I do what I have to. It doesn’t mean it doesn’t
affect me.” She took a deep breath and opened her duffel. “Ah shit.” She picked
at the ragged-edged remains of her scanproof compartment.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sorry about that,” Lucien said. “By the time I got my hands
on it, Doyle had already torn it apart. I was able to sweep your room at
Private before her people got there, though. Hope I got everything you need.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani thumbed through the bag’s contents. Her boots. Two sets
of coveralls. Underwear. Scanpack. Tools and parts. Her shooter, fully charged
and polished. The tiny soldier saluted her from an inside pocket, where he
stood guard over a static pouch containing an ID and cashcards.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She probed deeper. Her hand closed around the holocard. She
studied it in the half-light of the cabin, tilted it back and forth. The racers
swooped and glided, surfing the wind. She looked at Lucien out of the corner of
her eye. Lucien the manipulator, who could always be counted on to keep his
head. The frosty operator. The beautiful young man with the dead eyes. And a
cheek that had been a scratched mess four days before, but was almost healed
now. She touched her own shooter graze, mended to barest visibility. “You gave
me this card for a reason. For a while, I thought it was your oblique way of
telling me Lyssa was an augie. But that wasn’t it, was it? You were letting me
know. You’re an augie, too.” She waited until he answered with a scarcely
perceptible nod. “When did you have it done?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He touched the back of his neck, where bottom of skull met
top of spine. “About ten years ago. It was my fifteenth birthday present from
Anais.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Is it like mine?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not entirely. It’s an improved version of the one Martin
had. By then, they’d learned it was better to wait.” He turned down a narrower
road. In the distance, shuttleport lights blazed against the darkening sky. “I
don’t know if I’d be any different without it. Like they say, it only augments
what’s already there. Or in my case, what isn’t.” He bypassed the small charge
lot, parking the skimmer at the edge of the tarmac next to a large baggage
trolley. “Let’s get a move on.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
After a week of frigid cold, a comparative heat wave had
settled over the city, making coldsuits and face shields unnecessary. Jani
found the double layer of polycotton she wore adequate to keep her warm. She
lagged behind Lucien, who broke into a trot as he neared a line of shuttles
going through their preflight inspections. A serious-looking older woman in an
olive green flight suit, pilot’s headset dangling from her neck, walked out to
meet him.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani circled the woman’s ship. Late-model commercial
shuttle. Sleek. Well maintained. Even the most suspicious Customs agent would
think twice before searching it. It reeked of paid-up docking fees and clean
inspection records. Therein lay the problem. <i class="calibre4">I can’t afford to go anyplace
you could take me</i>. Jani reached up to stroke the shuttle’s smooth
underside. <i class="calibre4">And anyplace I want to go, you’d stand out like a boil</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She left Lucien and the pilot as they began the preflight
walkaround and set off on her own inspection. She passed along the short line
of shuttles, looking for signs of gold striping on the right side of the entry
door. Customs’ scarlet letter, a sign to all that dockscan had turned up
something suspicious and you’d been boarded and searched. Most ships sported at
least one such badge of infamy. Law of averages dictated you’d get nailed at
least once if you flew long enough. Two or three meant bad luck or a lousy
ship’s clerk. More than that meant stupidity or bloody-mindedness.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
No stripes, however, could mean one of two things. It could mean
the ship was brand-new, too young to have a record with Customs. Case in point,
Lucien’s ship.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Or it could mean the ship had changed hands recently. New
owner meant a clean bill of regulatory health for the vessel involved. New
owner could mean someone anxious to keep it that way. Someone unfamiliar with
the law of averages.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stopped before the first vessel she came to that had no
stripe. A few reentry blisters marred the polycoat skin—other than that, it
appeared in good shape. A serviceable shuttle. Older model. “Hello,” she said
to the pilot, who was in the midst of his own walkaround.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The man looked up from his recording board. A serviceable
face. Older model. “What do you want?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Nothing.” Jani smiled. “Just stretching my legs.” She
sidled up to him, peeking over his shoulder at the board display. Standard
preflight checklist. She spotted three coding mistakes in the first four
entries. Nothing that would interfere with the actual piloting of the vessel,
of course. But Treasury Customs didn’t give a rat’s furry ass whether a pilot
could hit his mark on an ocean float blindfolded. If that pilot could not fill
out his forms properly, that pilot would live to regret the oversight.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The man tensed when he realized he was being watched. “Is
there a problem, ma’am?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shrugged, backed off. Kept smiling. “Just checking out
your coding.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The man’s Adam’s apple bobbled. “What’s wrong with my
coding?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani pointed to the first entry. “You’ve entered takeoff
data on a docking line. When the board tries to calculate your flight stats,
you’ll get an error message.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So I’ll just erase and reenter.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If you don’t code the deletion, it won’t recognize your
erasure.” She took the board out of his hands. “You need to give it a reason,
so that when you download the data to Luna dockscan, it will read ‘entry error,
deletion because of such and such, reentry.’ Otherwise, it just sees an
unexplained mistake. Being a Cabinet system, it thinks, sloppiness. Then it
thinks, sloppy incompetent or sloppy on purpose? Then it calls a human.” She
activated the stylus and enacted the change. “A Customs docking inspection is a
hell of a way to start the day.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s just a mistake.” The pilot watched Jani make rapid
multistep entries without a hitch. “You know this stuff, huh?” He rubbed his
chin. “Have a look at the rest of it, if you don’t mind.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
It was so easy, Jani at first suspected a sting, a crackdown
on non-Registry clerks. The manifest, however, proved to contain the sorts of
convoluted, ingenious errors usually executed by someone who knew just enough
to be dangerous. The look on her face must have alarmed the pilot. He started
to say something as she handed the board back, but she cut him off with a
headshake and an absent “G’night.” She turned, started to walk away, counted. <i class="calibre4">One.
Two. Three. Do you want</i>—?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you want a job?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stopped, turned back, pretended not to understand.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Only if you need one, of course. But if you don’t, you
know, I’d pay for your time. I can get you back here tomorrow. If you need to
get back.” He stuck out his hand. “My name’s Zal.” He approached gingerly, his
face reddening. Obviously not the type to solicit strange women in
shuttle-ports, but honest working-class fear had made him desperate. “Take you
to Luna. Or farther. I’m starting a new transport business with my brother.
He’s handling the registration up there.” He waved in the general direction of
Earth’s only natural moon. “We sure could use the help, though. Someone who
knows how to fill out all these blasted forms.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The deal was cut quickly. Zal had been too relieved at the
thought of handing off clerical duty to ask Jani her name, which was fine with
her. It would give her time to think of one.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The stripped-down interior of this shuttle couldn’t compare
with the one in which she’d arrived a little over a week before. She strapped
herself into her seat, stuffed her duffel into the grapple rack beneath, then
started plowing through the manifest revisions. As the low powers rumbled to
life and the shuttle taxied toward the runway, she twisted in her seat to look
out the port. Lucien and his pilot had split up and were darting from vessel to
vessel, accosting everyone they saw. Then the shuttle turned, and they
disappeared from view. Within minutes, takeoff acceleration drove Jani into her
seat.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sorry, Lucien. I just don’t like being herded.” She felt a
pang of guilt that she hadn’t said a proper good-bye after all he had done for
her, but it soon passed. She liked him. Therefore, they would find one another
again. She could adopt Nema’s attitude, use it to keep her warm tonight.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her old teacher’s gift glinted in the cabin light as she
wrote. Jani glanced out the port again as the shuttle banked over Chicago on
the way to its exit corridor. It struck her how the ring’s glittering red stone
mimicked the lights of the city below. And foretold the lights of the cities to
come. Wherever they were.
