<p class="NormalFirst">
A first book is usually the most difficult to write,
firstly, because you’re still trying to find your sea legs, and secondly,
because you’ve no assurance whatsoever that what you’ve spent years producing
will go anywhere other than a box in the cellar.

I’ve been lucky enough to have had help from many people in
assisting me through the difficulties. In particular, I’d like to thank
Katharine Eliska Kimbriel, who helped keep me on track, and my parents, Gordon
and Charlotte Smith, whose love and support helped keep me going.
