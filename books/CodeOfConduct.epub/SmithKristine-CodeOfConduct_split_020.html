<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_29">Chapter 16</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
<i class="calibre4">In response to the
repeated inquiries of your staff, I regret to inform you, nìRau . . .</i>
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The note had been written on Ulanova’s personal stationery,
Tsecha noted. Thick, stone-colored parchment nearly idomeni in quality, edged
in black and topped with a bird possessing two heads. The minister’s family
symbol. <i class="calibre4">Two heads. Two faces</i>. He bared his teeth. He was becoming quite
good with double meanings, and truly. Perhaps the day would come when his old
handheld would no longer be needed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
. . . <i class="calibre4">that the matter we discussed earlier
today has, unfortunately, not been resolved. After further inquiry, it has been
determined that my initial conclusions were in error</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She fooled you, Anais.” Tsecha walked slowly to his favored
chair and sat carefully to prevent the angled frame from poking him. “But she
fooled all you humanish. Until that last evening at Knevçet Shèràa, your kind
thought you knew Captain Kilian most well.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">This avenue of exploration, regrettably, appears closed
at this time. Rest assured, nìRau, and truly, that I will keep you apprised of
any new developments</i>. a lète ona vèste, <i class="calibre4">Nemarau. Anais Ulanova</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Glories of the day to you, Nema</i>. Tsecha reread the
letter once, then again, his gaze drawn repeatedly to the final line, the
curves and slashes of his born language. Quite adequate High Vynshàrau—the
proper accents, the appropriate phrasing for his skein and standing. He could
find no fault with it. Some Exterior suborn must have labored most diligently
to produce the deceivingly simple phrase. And yet . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">You did not know me in the time before, Anais. You have
no right to call me by my born name</i>. He would answer to few idomeni who
referred to him as Nema. Not even from his less-favored chosen humans, Tsai and
Senna, Aryton and Nawar, would he tolerate such.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My born name is for the very few</i>. Esteemed enemies,
some. Most favored, others. Hansen Wyle, if he had lived, would know him only
as Nema. <i class="calibre4">And my toxin</i>. His excellent Captain, whom Ulanova had
apparently misplaced.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha settled back against his unforgiving cushions and set
the Exterior Minister’s letter on the chairside table. Such careful wording, on
unofficial paper. <i class="calibre4">She would not seem so tall now, I think</i>. Ulanova had
stumbled, and badly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Yet that morning, she had been so sure.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Humanish like my Anais do not state themselves strongly
without reason</i>. So between the morning and the afternoon, she had been
thwarted, but how? <i class="calibre4">To whom may I speak of this</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha looked across his room. His newly acquired comport, a
bulky hybrid hastily adapted by his dominant Communications suborn to function
within Commonwealth systems, rested on his inscribing table.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
His newly acquired, <i class="calibre4">unmonitored</i>, comport.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He had had a most difficult time convincing his Security of
his need for such. But he had, in the end, persuaded. He had, after all, once
convinced a mixed-sect mob that, whatever they may truly have wished,
dismembering him with long blades and adding him to the soul circle burning
around Rauta Shèràa was not part of it. Thus had he sidestepped death. And if
so death, why not Embassy Security?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha approached his comport as though it were a piece of
engine wreckage which could explode. He had not yet used it, and the
instruction provided by the Communications suborn had lacked detail. He touched
the activation pad, feeling a tingle of accomplishment as the display
shimmered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He released the touchlock of one of the drawers and withdrew
a folded sheet of parchment. True idomeni paper, smooth as metalcloth, its
color the soft pink of the inside of a cavashell. Tsecha unfolded it, laid it
on the desktop, and watched the creases lessen, straighten, then disappear
completely until only the handwritten series of humanish numbers and letters
marred its surface.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The code had been carefully acquired, requested with many
others so that Tsecha’s agents would not suspect its worth. He tapped it into
the comport touchpad, then pulled his favored chair tableside as a series of
low, ringing tones told him the connection had been made.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Moments later, rainbow light splayed across the display,
assembling to form a most familiar face. “Glories of the day to you, Physician
DeVries,” Tsecha said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Watery dark eyes, downturned at the corners, squinted, then
widened. “<i class="calibre4">Nema</i>!” The sagged face, too much pale skin on too little bone,
quivered. “How in hell did you get this number?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I bought it, DeVries.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“From whom?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“As you said to me once, long ago, ah, sir, that would be
telling.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Son of a—” Eamon DeVries’s jaw clamped, cutting off the
balance of the insult. <i class="calibre4">Something of my lineage</i>, Tsecha thought, <i class="calibre4">of
that I am most sure</i>. Although the most unseemly of the three doctors who
had founded Neoclona, the man had always been, in a fashion almost as idomeni,
comfortably predictable.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He bared his teeth, but not very much. “I could only obtain
your satellite office code, unfortunately, Physician DeVries. Physician
Parini’s, I could not—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He’s out of town.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—nor could I Physician Shroud’s. Most unfortunate, in that
case, because he is the one to whom I must speak.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
DeVries sat back and folded his arms across his chest. “I
would rather,” he said slowly, “be strung up by my nuts over a bonfire than
tell John <i class="calibre4">you</i> want to talk to him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Find him, Eamon. Tell him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I can’t disturb him.” Flaps of skin shook back and forth.
“He’s in the lab.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“In the lab!” Tsecha folded his arms as DeVries had. “Still?
After so much time? Is it true what is said, that he sleeps within, eats
within, never leaves?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He works, Nema. You remember how he works.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And I remember as well what he works on. Who does he hide
in his basement now?” Tsecha revealed his teeth more as DeVries’s face ceased
its movement. “Physician DeVries, if you possess any sense, you will tell John
Shroud I wish to speak to him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
DeVries muttered of “ruined days” and “hell to pay,” and
disappeared.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha stared at the blank display. <i class="calibre4">Perhaps I pushed too
greatly</i>? And now Eamon DeVries would alter his code. He resigned himself to
planning yet another subterfuge. Fortunately, his Security could probably find
DeVries’s new code as they had this one. From a humanish female who sold.
Hansen had been the first to discover that with Physician DeVries, there could
always be found a female who sold.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The display flickered again. Tsecha stiffened as the face
formed. Just as familiar, this face, but some humanish compelled more attention
than others. He nodded toward the display. “John.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Eyes, pale blue as ice, glinted. “My God, it really is you.
I thought Eamon had been dipping into the drug bins again.” Long-fingered hands
combed through lazored hair which shone as a young one’s. White hands. White
hair. Rimed eyes the only color in a white face. A body wrapped in death-glaze.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">John Shroud is an . . . albino</i>. Yes,
that was the word, and truly. Tsecha forced himself to look the man in the
face. Still so sharp the bones, like Vynshàrau, skin taut as paint over muscle
and bone. “Yes, John, it really is me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
John bared his teeth. They glistened even more than his
hair. “It figures you’d get hold of <i class="calibre4">Eamon’s</i> code. The idiot scribbles it
on everything short of restroom walls.” And the voice. <i class="calibre4">A back-of-the-cave
voice</i>, Hansen had called it, <i class="calibre4">the word from the bottom of the well</i>.
When an idomeni possessed such a voice, it was said to come from the center of
the soul, but whether one could say such in John’s case, Tsecha did not know.
Allowing the man possession of a soul seemed, as again Hansen would have said,
a stretch.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, points to you, Nema.” John tilted his head well to
his left, until he looked at Tsecha sideways. Unseemly familiarity in that, but
such was his way. “Imagine seeing you again after all these years. Such a
pleasure, I can’t begin to say. I have to get back to work now. See you in the
newssheets.” He drew up straight. A hand flicked toward a touchpad, to end the
connection.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">John</i>!” Tsecha gripped the sides of his display as
though doing such could trap the man within. “If I wanted to find her, how
could I?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
John’s hand stilled. Pale eyes stared. Such a color. So
cold. And artificial, the result of filming. His born eyes were pink. <i class="calibre4">Lab
rat, they called him, in youth</i>. That knowledge always seemed to give Hansen
such pleasure.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The bone white hand lowered. “Who are you talking about,
Nema?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Her, John. <i class="calibre4">Her</i>. I believe she is alive.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
John’s face deadened even more. “You believe? You don’t
know?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That is why I ask you. Her paper is yours. Her history. How
would you search for her? How would <i class="calibre4">you</i> confirm she lives?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
John sat back, hands to his mouth, fingertips pressed
together. The movement allowed Tsecha a glimpse of the short-sleeved,
collarless white shirt he wore. The trousers, Tsecha knew, would be white as
well. <i class="calibre4">Medwhites</i>, humanish called them. John’s favored clothing. During
his time in Rauta Shèràa, he seldom wore anything else.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Assuming I care,” John said, “why should I tell you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh, you care, John</i>. “Ulanova wants her . . .
arrested, I believe is the word.” Tsecha released his display, sat back,
paused. Periods of silence seemed as important in humanish speech as in some
idomeni. <i class="calibre4">We like to let things sink in</i>, Hansen had taught him. “She
believes it is the wish of the idomeni for that arrest, as well. But I possess
no such wish.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you sure your people feel the same, Nema? I seem to
recall a few riots concerning that very wish. Demands for your own arrest. Oh,
for the good old days.” John struggled to bare his teeth but failed. “Why does
Anais want to arrest her?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The Exterior Minister requires her as a tool only, I
believe. To destroy Evan van Reuter.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
John’s barely visible eyebrows arched. “Evan? Is that
secession issue heating up again? I remember Anais thinking her van Reuter
problems would end when Acton died. Guess not.” Bony fingers tapped against
cheekbone. Tsecha almost expected to hear the click. “Unless the rumors about
old Ev being responsible for Lyssa’s death are true. But even then, would Anais
care? She and Lyssa despised one another because of that scandal over Lyssa’s
father.” He frowned. “Unfortunately, Val’s my muck and sludge specialist, and
he’s unavailable.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha bared his teeth with enthusiasm. “Please allow my
glories of the day to the most excellent Physician Parini when he returns from
his vacation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
John’s frown grew. “You always liked him, didn’t you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I found him always most seemly, yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But you hate him as well?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes to that also, John. As a most esteemed enemy, how else
could he be regarded by me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hmm.” John worked his hands together as though he held
something he wished to mold. “Sh-she . . . always tried to
explain that to me. I didn’t understand then, and it still makes no sense.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha eased against his lumpy cushions. “But you never
possessed the wish to learn of idomeni. You only possessed the wish to take
from idomeni. Most disordered, John. Balance must always be maintained.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So says the priest.” John’s face turned most as a wall. His
hands ceased movement. “You’re no stranger to taking, Nema. If you’d been
allowed your way, if that bloody war and your bloody Temple hadn’t stopped you,
how much would you have taken from them? From Wyle? From—especially from—” His
jaw continued to work, but no sound emerged.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha looked into John Shroud’s ungodly eyes. “I do not
take, John. I possess no wish to possess. I only allow what must become to
become. As a propitiator, I can do nothing else.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The future as you see it? A race of human-idomeni hybrids
with you as its spiritual leader?” John laughed quietly. “Hundreds of years
ago, a human who said things like that would have been burned at the stake.
Your people had the right idea, Nema. Maybe we are more alike than we realize.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha sat heavy in his chair. “Why must I always explain as
to young ones? We must merge together. In the end, all will be as one. All the
same. So it must be, John, for the journey to the Star to be complete.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Your journey! To your Star! We don’t believe in your Star!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But yet you began the journey yourself, John. The first
span in the bridge was built by you. You are as responsible as I for what she
will become. What we will all become.” Tsecha’s heart pounded hard and slow in
his chest. Not since he had worked to persuade the Council to name him
ambassador had he felt so alive. “I always felt you reasoned as a physician, of
course, in your experimentation. You wished to heal her, to improve her. Hansen
believed, though, something most different. ‘He just wants another freak to
keep him company,’ is what he said.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Shroud’s hands drew apart slowly as he sat forward in his
chair. “Hansen Wyle,” he said through his teeth, “was as crazy as you are.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My Hansen was most sane, as I am. We tried so to find her,
but you hid her well. And now, you who hid her should know how to find her. How
would I know her? For her good, for yours, for us all, do you not think I
should find her first?” Tsecha inscribed shapes in the air to ward off demons.
He could not be as humanish, now. “My Captain. My suborn. She who will follow
me. Your Jani. How will I know her?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
John stared at him. Even his hate could not warm his eyes.
“She’s dead.” His hand flashed white motion, and his face fragmented.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Before the man’s image faded completely, Tsecha reentered
the code. Several times. But after each attempt, the display only flickered as
the comport audio emitted a series of low beeps. <i class="calibre4">So quickly you work to
thwart me, John</i>. He berated himself for revealing his soul so to the
humanish, but it could not be helped. They merely spoke of what was already
well-known—why did saying truth aloud matter so to humanish?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">If they do not speak of it, it does not exist. If they do
not think of it, it goes away</i>. Illuminating thoughts, perhaps. Explanations
of humanish behavior. But not logical. Tsecha relaxed into his chair, allowing
the framing to stab him where it would and thus focus his mind. <i class="calibre4">They are not
as idomeni</i>. But in some future time, they would be. <i class="calibre4">And idomeni will be
as they</i>. Rather sooner, that inevitability, if his Council’s behavior with
regard to the idomeni sicknesses was indication. The thought made him hesitate.
<i class="calibre4">John and I as one</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
From far away, the tones announcing his late-afternoon
sacrament sounded. Tsecha rose as quickly as his bent, inflexible seat allowed,
but not before resetting the comport for internal communication and notifying
Security of his wish for a conference.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">John and I as one</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha pressed his open left palm against his stomach, a
gesture of supplication. Perhaps, for one of his standing, to understand fully
was not to be, but the gift of some intimation struck him as most seemly—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">John and I as one</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
—and greatly to be wished.
