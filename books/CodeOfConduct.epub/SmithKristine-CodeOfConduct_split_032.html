<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani entered the infirmary to find Angevin in the midst of
an animated discussion with the duty nurse. “How many times do I have to tell
you”—she struck the check-in counter—“I’m not sick anymore. I’m fine!” The
nurse, tall and heavily built, folded his arms and seemed ready to dig in for
the duration.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How about if she agrees to come back every couple of
hours?” Jani leaned against the counter and gave the nurse a commiserating
smile. “I know she’s supposed to be in shock, but does she look shocky to you?
I mean, she has her color back.” She leaned close to Angevin, who glared at
her. “Her pupils look ok. I can’t speak for confused behavior, but two out of
three isn’t bad.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I should have kicked you,” Angevin grumbled as they
departed a few minutes later. Security guards were stationed near the elevators
and stairwell doors; every so often, one would pop his head around a corner
like a treechuck. “And why do I have to check in? It’s so stupid—I feel fine!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s a good idea,” Jani countered. “Doyle wouldn’t have
sent you up here if she didn’t think you looked shaky.” The thought also
crossed her mind that the colonel would want Angevin closeted in a well-guarded
place as long as Steve remained at large, but she kept it to herself.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Doyle just sent me here to get me out of the way. I
fainted, ok. It was my first dead body.” Angevin snorted in disgust. “Doyle
didn’t take it so well, either. Saw her swallow hard a few times.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She’s a human being, Angevin. The day she stops swallowing
hard is the day she better change professions.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You didn’t even blink! Just stood in the doorway and took
it all in.” Angevin keyed into her office. The look she shot Jani held envy,
but something else as well. As in, <i class="calibre4">I wish I could do that. I think</i>. “Did
you spot any clues?” She made a show of checking her paper message box.
“Anything that could clear Steve?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani thought back to the scene in the carrel. <i class="calibre4">I spied with
my warped little eye</i> . . . something she’d rather not say.
Betha had looked so much like Yolan, and in looking like Yolan, she had brought
Borgie back for a little while. Jani flexed her shoulders. Her back felt loose.
Her hip worked smoothly. Her stomach had even stopped aching. <i class="calibre4">You ghoul—a
young woman is dead and you react by feeling better than you have in weeks</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where the hell could he be hiding?” Angevin locked the
door, then headed for her comport. “He couldn’t have had enough time to get off
the compound.” She activated the unit and checked her voicebox. Message after
message bit the trashbin after only a few words. “Where the hell is he!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, I should hope he wouldn’t be dumb enough to leave you
a message.” Jani dragged a chair deskside. “He’d have to know Doyle would
check.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She wouldn’t dare!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“There’s been a murder, Angevin. She can, she would, and
more than likely she already has.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She wouldn’t have deleted it, would she?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, she’d let you hear it. Then she’d hope Steve would give
himself away to you and you’d lead her to him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fuck.” Angevin dropped into her chair. “Risa, he didn’t do
it.” She pulled at the hem of her baggy pullover. “But why did he run away like
that?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Durian had two V-40s pointed in his direction. The gut
reaction of anyone with one working neuron would be to run.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You didn’t.” That look, again. “You took it out of the
guard’s hands.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I got lucky—she didn’t know how to handle it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But you did.” Angevin’s gaze was steady and decidedly
nonshocky. “Don’t you have a guess where Steve could be?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani rummaged through her duffel. She pulled out a squat
brushed-metal cylinder, twisted the top, and set it on the desk. “This should
buy us a few minutes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin eyed the device skeptically. “What is it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Insecticide.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She’s bugged my office!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The court order was probably fiched over here while you
were on your way to the infirmary. Just audio, probably. Holofield, they
reserve for real crooks.” <i class="calibre4">Like us after today—who knows</i>? Jani adjusted
the cylinder until it rested in a direct line between the two of them. “But
don’t be surprised if someone from Systems shows up soon waving a repair order
you don’t remember requesting. The interference pattern this thing emits reads
a lot like a transmission from a blown workstation card.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How do you get hold of something like that?” Angevin’s
voice held the greedy wonder of someone ready to pull out a recorder and take
notes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, you can get hold of anything. All depends how much
you’re willing to give in return.” Jani stroked the device with a fingertip.
“With regard to Steve, there are a few places I can check—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin shot to her feet. “Let’s go.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not so fast.” She waved the young woman back into her seat.
“<i class="calibre4">You</i> stay here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Bullshit!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Doyle has her eye on me sort of. You, she’s watching like a
hawk. The best thing you can do for Steve is stay here. Work. Make lots of
calls. Walk the wing from end to end and talk to everyone you see. Check in at
the infirmary every two hours.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin’s expression slowly lightened. “You want me to draw
attention away from you while you hunt around?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It can’t hurt.” Jani raised a finger to her lips, then
swept her device off the desk and back into her bag. “Keep a good thought,” she
said as she headed for the door. “I’m going to head back to Private for a
while.” Angevin offered Jani a thumbs-up, then turned back to her comport with
a determined glare.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Where are you, Steven, you little jerk</i>? Jani stuck
her head in the alternate breakroom and encountered two guards playing cards at
one of the battered tables. No one else was in the room; judging from the
surprise on the guards’ faces, dexxies had been avoiding the place the entire
morning.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Every elevator and stairway Jani passed was monitored by at
least one guard. She stopped on the second floor and entered the women’s locker
room next to the main gymnasium. She checked the ceiling directly overhead. <i class="calibre4">They
wouldn’t have video in here, would they</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She dug into her trouser pocket for the tiny key card she
had stolen earlier from the gymnasium office and slid the uncomplicated plastic
sliver into its lockslot. For the benefit of any viewing device, she rummaged
through a stack of washcloths and towels. When she came to the towel in which
she’d wrapped the Court of Inquiry report, she rolled it into a loose cylinder
and stuffed it into her duffel. She followed with a washcloth and some soap.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She stopped at the sink to wash her hands. <i class="calibre4">Always have a
reason to be where you are</i>. The soap was black, with the throaty scent of a
humid summer night. <i class="calibre4">I came here to try this soap—I overheard people in the
hallway talking about this soap—this soap is legend</i>. She wrapped the wet
bar in the washcloth and stuffed it into her bag.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Only a few employees walked the hall outside the locker
room. Jani paused to study the message board outside the gym. Then she stopped
at one of the glass panels set at regular intervals along the wide hall and
spent a few minutes watching a man and a woman play handball. She felt calm.
The rest of the world seemed to be moving just a bit more slowly than she.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She entered a lounge area filled with uniformed and
plain-clothes employees, sat at one of the small tables, and paged through the
newssheet the previous occupant had left behind. When the noise level of the
room dipped, she looked up. A pair of guards had wandered in and were perusing
the contents of a vend cooler. Around her, she could hear the murmurs. “Murder . . .
girl . . . the parts bins.” She checked her timepiece. One and a
half hours since they had found Betha’s body. Well, if Doyle wanted to alarm
the entire House and waste manpower in the process, she was certainly doing a
good job. Jani watched the guards until they departed. Then she left as well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Where are you hiding, Steven</i>? Jani shuffled down the
hall toward the elevators. She didn’t bother to eavesdrop on any of the groups
clustered in corners and near doorways. It didn’t take a genius to figure out
what they talked about.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Fear not, citizens—your friends in Security have it all
under control</i>. She rode down to the lowest parking level; once in the
tunnel, she hitched a ride to Private on a grocery skim. She rode the elevator
to her door and keyed herself inside. The housekeepers had been through,
apparently. Her bed had been made and the air possessed the eye-watering scent
of cleansing agents. Jani sniffed again and wrinkled her nose. Odd smell for a
cleanser. Sharp. Spicy. Familiar.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh no</i>!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Out of the corner of her eye, she detected movement.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Risa?” Steve walked into the sitting room, his cupped hand
hiding his smoking ’stick. “Don’t yell. I can explain.”
