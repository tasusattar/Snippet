<p class="NormalFirst">
The balance of the meal passed uneventfully. Make that the
imbalance. Embers of conversation sparked fitfully, only to die. Except for her
single instance of fashion commentary, Angevin remained silent. Ridgeway was
sociable, though guarded, while Evan alternated between expansiveness and
distraction as the synergistic effects of lack of sleep and generous servings
of five varieties of wine took hold. He had always enjoyed his liquor, but you’d
think he’d have known better.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Now is not the time, Evan</i>. After-dinner iced water in
hand, Jani left the three behind to talk—or in Angevin’s case, listen—shop. She
examined the artwork in Evan’s sitting room, then paused before an official
portrait of the Interior Minister and his late wife. Evan looked thin and worn.
His dress tunic hung on his slim frame like woven lead. Lyssa, also in black,
appeared drawn and pale. Neither had made any attempt to smile.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That was taken almost three years ago, a short time after
the children died.” Durian Ridgeway drew alongside. The tiny glass he held
contained a bright pink, presumably lethal, liqueur. “Too soon, in my opinion.
They both look ill. It’s not the kind of image you want to see scattered
throughout the Commonwealth.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani glanced into the dining room. Evan was holding forth
and gesturing broadly as a seated Angevin Wyle stared and nodded like someone
in a trance. <i class="calibre4">Bewitching, isn’t he</i>? Even after all these years. <i class="calibre4">You’d
think I’d have acquired immunity by now</i>. “Pity Evan and Lyssa couldn’t time
their tragedies better.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway’s eyebrows arched. “I’m sure I sound harsh, but
that is part of my job. To observe, monitor, see things which perhaps His
Excellency would miss.” He drew closer. Jani forced herself to stand still as
he brushed against her bare shoulder. “Well, Ms. Tyi, this must all be a big
change for you. From a little post on Hortensia to a Cabinet-class ship, all in
a matter of weeks. But, you know what they say.” He mumbled a few sentences, of
which she recognized little and understood nothing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Servir? Servirat? I’ll bet that’s Josephani</i>. Her
supposed native language, of which she knew zip. “I beg your pardon, Mr.
Ridgeway?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Would you like me to repeat it, Ms. Tyi?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Judging from your accent, I don’t think it would help.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He pressed closer. Jani felt his breath in her ear as his
chest pushed against her left arm. The numb one. All she felt was the pressure.
“If you couldn’t understand that, understand this. The contents of the files I
will be turning over to you, if revealed, could shake the Commonwealth to its
foundations. If anything happens to that paper while it’s registered to your
control, I will not rest until I personally grind you to fine powder with my
bare hands.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No need to be melodramatic, Mr. Ridgeway.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I have been with Evan for fifteen years. Since I left
school, my primary duty has been to him. I will not stand by and watch
everything he’s built get blown to bloody fuck-all for the sake of one of his
whims.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The fruity odor of Ridgeway’s breath filled Jani’s nose. Her
full stomach gurgled in protest as she forced herself to look him in the face.
His eyes watered—the liqueur was apparently as potent as she thought. “If you
have anything to say to me, mister, you really should wait until you sober up.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway’s bleary glower sharpened. “You don’t like me, Ms.
Tyi. That’s fine—I’m not mad for you, either. I don’t believe your
participation in what I consider should remain an in-House investigation is
necessary.” He took a step back.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But we both follow orders, don’t we? Live to serve? That’s
what I tried to tell you before, and so badly, too. I do apologize.” He
strolled from the portrait to a display case of ornaments, gesturing for Jani
to follow. “But now, I think we understand one another. The idomeni have a term
for our particular brand of impasse. Esteemed enemy. For now, let us consider
ourselves esteemed enemies.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We’d have to have a ceremony,” Jani said, “to declare it
properly. There are offertories to the gods, followed by the shedding of blood
through ritual combat.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway offered a sly smile. “Is that a challenge, Risa?
Perhaps later. It sounds very . . . cross-cultural.” He reached
into the display case and fingered a polished shell. “What do you think of Ms.
Wyle?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">She’s like her father</i>. “She’s like most dexxies.
Rough around the edges. Needs some social buffing.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway scowled at Jani’s use of the slang term for
documents examiner. “Buffing,” he said pointedly. “Not a day goes by when I
don’t stifle the urge to throttle her. But considering her background, I make
allowances.” He returned the shell to its niche. “You’ve heard of her father,
of course?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hansen?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes. One of only six humans to degree at the Academy in
Rauta Shèràa. One of only six to study the paper system with the race that
perfected it. What an honor.” Jani could hear the envy in Ridgeway’s voice.
“Then that damned war started, and he had to stick his nose in. What a waste.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani struggled to keep her tone level. “From what I’ve
heard, he knew the Laumrau leaders. He knew the Vynshà. I believe he did what
he thought best, in order to help.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And the shatterbox found the building he was in anyway, and
the building collapsed on him anyway, and he died anyway, even though he was
only trying to help.” Ridgeway pushed the display case toward the center of the
table. Jani winced as the metal supports screeched against the polished wood.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Now the idomeni are back,” she said, “and you have to work
with them. How do you reconcile that?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t,” Ridgeway replied too quickly. “But I do have the
opportunity to help the daughter of the man I grew up wanting to emulate.” The
look in his eyes grew reverential. “Hansen was more than one of the six. He was
One of Six. They were treated like idomeni, constantly being tested—the
pressure was unending. But he always came out on top. He was the best.” He
sighed. “I’m afraid Angevin will have to emerge from under a fairly formidable
shadow.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani worked her tensing shoulders. “I think,” she said
slowly, “part of the girl’s problem, if she indeed has one, will be in having
to deal with other people’s expectations.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“True. True.” Ridgeway nodded sagely, his sarcasm detector
apparently flooded with ethanol. “All we can do is all we can. In the end it’s
up to her. No one can work magic with someone fundamentally unsuited to the
task at hand.” He gave Jani a superior smile, his sarcasm synthesizer
apparently functioning just fine. “Speaking of which, why don’t we get this
transfer over with? You realize what I’m handing over to you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.” Jani did a mental ten count. “You’re giving me
sensitive files pertinent to the investigation of Lyssa van Reuter’s death,
which contain details of His Excellency’s life.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, they contain details, all right. Their contents may
shock even a jaded soul like you, Ms. Tyi. We never realize what Mother
Commonwealth knows about us until it’s too late.” Ridgeway offered her his arm.
“Shall we?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin bounded to her feet as Jani and Ridgeway reentered
the dining room. “His Excellency’s been telling me the most ripping things! All
about the idomeni!” Her enthusiasm withered as soon as her eyes met Ridgeway’s.
She walked over to the sideboard and rummaged through a large leather bag. From
it, she removed a sheaf of papers and three pouches, two the size of a man’s
hand, one much larger.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
In the meantime, Ridgeway collected the documents case and
carried it to the dining room table. Evan, fresh from making young women’s eyes
shine, perched on the arm of a nearby chair and graced Jani with a tired grin.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The grin died when he saw what Ridgeway was doing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">We knew this was coming, Evan</i>. Jani pulled her duffel
from beneath her chair, cracked the fasteners, and removed her own small,
scuffed pouch. <i class="calibre4">Besides, what can go wrong</i>? She knew the answer to that.
She would just try not to think about it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The world of close-controlled paper did get complicated at
times, but an ownership transfer was one of the simpler procedures. As Angevin
Wyle laid out the logs that they each would sign and date, Ridgeway prepared to
reprogram the case’s touchlocks to accept Jani’s prints.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Of course, he’d have to scan her hands and retinas first,
and run a comparison check against the various databases each Cabinet-class
ship contained within its systems. Criminal. Service. Medical. A matter of
procedure. Everyone understood that. Just another form to file away for future
audits.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway smirked as he removed his scanner from the largest
of the three pouches and activated it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani heard Evan fidget behind her. She smiled, which seemed
to disappoint Ridgeway. He pouted when she stepped without hesitation into
range of the boxlike scanner and held out her hands.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But my handprints aren’t the same, are they</i>? Or her
retinas. The doctors who had reassembled her had been, after all, very
forward-thinking. She watched as a bright yellow light throbbed beneath the
scanner’s surface. The device hummed, then the indicator display glowed bright,
clear green.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Happy, Durian?” Evan asked, injecting the distilled essence
of generations of Familial ennui into his voice.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Just following prescribed procedure, Ev,” Ridgeway said as
he stuffed the scanner back into its pouch. “Better safe than sorry.” Using a
UV stylus, he opened the switches in the document case’s control panel, waited
for Jani to place her palm against the sensor pad, then closed the switches,
locking in her print as the key.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Just like the good old days</i>. Jani glanced at Evan,
who winked back. She removed her scanpack from its cracked plastic pouch. The
oval device contained a mass of her farmed brain tissue, through which a
network of nervelinks and data chips had been implanted. Working together to
serve as guideposts on a roadway, the unit and its attachments stored the data
necessary to enable its owner to navigate through the documents maze. Her
brain-in-a-box, literally. How long had it been since she’d used it as it was
meant to be used? In front of her peers, during a high-level documents
transaction?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani brushed a few flecks of dirt from the scanpack’s
surface. Over twenty years of use meant that the hand-sized,
five-centimeter-thick oval didn’t look much better than its container.
Scratches dulled its black polycoat finish. Some of the touchpad labeling had
been worn away. She examined the nutrient insert slot along the side, then sniffed
quickly. No fishy odor, which would have signaled a leak in the spent nutrient
broth line, a sure sign of a poorly maintained ’pack. That had never been a
problem for her, but accidents did happen. If Ridgeway even suspected she
didn’t maintain her equipment, she knew she’d never hear the end of it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway looked from his own immaculate tortoiseshell unit
to Jani’s. “Oh, Ms. Tyi, that is a confidence-builder.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shrugged. “The problem with having nice things, Mr.
Ridgeway, is that in some of the places I’ve lived, there are those who would
wish to separate them from me. I try to avoid trouble.” She turned on her
device, waited for the display to activate, then gently slid it over the first
of the three forms.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The sensors on the ’pack’s underside evaluated the paper
surface, analyzed the inks and metal foils decorating the ornate document,
decoded the encryptions contained in the chips and prionics embedded in the
parchment. <i class="calibre4">Everything but Luna’s phase on the day it was made</i>—that’s
what the document would tell her scanpack, which then would compare that
information to the data stored in its own chips and cells.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Bright green identification strings scrolled across the
display. “It’s a current-issue Interior Ministry ownership transfer log, all
right,” Jani said to Ridgeway. She ignored his glower, affixed her signature to
the document, then moved on to the next as Angevin and Ridgeway completed their
portion of the first. After all three forms were completed, they each took one
copy. Jani stashed hers in her duffel, while Angevin returned hers and
Ridgeway’s to the leather bag.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are we finally finished?” Evan groaned. “I don’t know how
any business gets completed in a timely fashion these days.” He sounded bored,
but his face showed the drained relief of a man whose fever had finally broken.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, Ev, you can go to bed now,” Ridgeway said as he jammed
his ’pack back into its sheath. He followed up the snappish remark with a
smile, but that did little to counter his bundled-underwear edginess. “We will
be disembarking late day after tomorrow, at Padishah,” he said to Jani. “If you
need any assistance afterward, zip us a message through message central
transmit. We’ll do what we can.” He eyed her scanpack again. “I’m sure the
equipment you work with leaves something to be desired.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin walked over to Jani, looking at her for the first
time with something akin to a smile. “Looks used,” she said, pointing to the
scanpack’s battered case.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani nodded. “It has been.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin was about to say something else, but Ridgeway linked
her arm through his and led her away.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Till tomorrow, Ev,” he said as they left. “And a good
evening to you as well, Ms. Tyi. You will remember what we talked about?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What was that all about?” Evan asked after the sliders
closed. “Don’t tell me—Durian was being Durian.” He eased into a lounge chair
and ran a hand over his face. Even in the cabin’s soft illumination, his skin
looked dull. “Forgive him, Jan—he takes damned good care of me in the bargain.
And he’s worried about those docs.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re not?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m not sure what you’ll think of me after reading some of
them, but I have to take that chance. Besides, I trust you.” He studied Jani
for a few moments, his expression neutral. Then he motioned for her to take the
seat across from him.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Like Durian said, in two days we’ll reach Padishah. He and
Ange will be catching a Service courier that will get them home a week ahead of
the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>.” He took a deep breath. “I need to go with them. Elyas is
petitioning to reopen colonial secession talks. Along with the other Outer
Circle worlds, they somehow dragged the Jewellers’ Loop into the brawl, and
that means lots of might and money flying around. The centrists want me home.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani said nothing. Instead, she watched Evan’s hands, as she
had learned to do during their time together. They rested easily on his knees.
No nail-picking. No sleeve-tugging. Either he told the truth or he’d learned to
hide his lies better.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’d been debating telling you for days. Thought if I
mentioned it, I’d give you just another excuse to bolt. But I’ve no choice.
Duty calls.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You roust me out of my home, close off my escape routes,
then tell me you’re leaving me alone among strangers for five weeks?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan wrinkled his nose. “Whalen was no home. And you don’t
need any escape routes.” His eyes sparked. “Besides, I’m more concerned for the
strangers than I am for you.” His stare deepened and his features slackened
until he wore the bewildered, slightly stunned expression Jani remembered from
their first meeting. “I wish I could stay.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">If you’re going to look at me like that, maybe it’s
better you don’t</i>. Jani tugged as unobtrusively as she could at the bodice
of her dress. A waste of time—the silky material snapped back into snug place
like a second skin. “Well, I may be able to work better without you around.”
She snuck a peek at Evan beneath her lashes. He wore evening clothes as easily
as other men wore ship coveralls; now, as he unfastened the stiff formal tunic,
he looked very agreeably rumpled. <i class="calibre4">You’re still the best-looking man I’ve
ever known</i>. Yes, and he had very good reasons to go out of his way to make
her feel cosseted and comfortable. If it so happened that keeping her cozy
could get him laid, he wouldn’t turn it down. Remember the pragmatist.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Not fair</i>. Except for that single grumble in the Amsun
station bathroom concerning their breakup, he had been silent on the matter of
their past. <i class="calibre4">Sheep’s eyes don’t count</i>. Those could be chalked up to a
heavy meal and too much alcohol. <i class="calibre4">Neither do wicked thoughts</i>. Lucky for
her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The centrists,” she said, “think the colonies will require
a lengthy period of adjustment before full independence can be granted. I’ve
heard numbers ranging from ten to one hundred years. Speaking as a colonial, I
don’t think we need babying.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
If Evan noticed the abrupt cool-off, he hid it beneath a
veneer of serious reflection. “The coalition pushing for these talks is led by
a group being advised by Ulanova. They may know how to run businesses, but they
don’t know how to run governments. They’d need her help, and she’d give them
just enough to keep their heads above water until they needed her again. That’s
not true independence.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Maybe it’s enough to get them started.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t know Anais, Jan. Once she’d sunk her claws into
that power base, she’d never let go. She wouldn’t rest until she was PM of her
own little Commonwealth.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Funny she doesn’t believe she can get what she wants with
an Earthbound government,” Jani said. “But then, you’re fairly isolated with
respect to GateWays. You’ve turned into a planet-sized office building over the
years—you’ve got no substantial manufacturing or shipping anymore. The colonies
are where the money is. By comparison, you’re stagnant.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan scowled. “I wish you’d stop saying ‘you.’” He sagged
against the cushions and clasped his hands behind his head. “Are you angry with
me? For holding out on you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani twitched a shoulder. It twitched back. “A little.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll be waiting for you in Chicago. You will show up, won’t
you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He looked up at the ceiling and exhaled slowly. “Thank you.
I’ll sleep more easily tonight.” He stifled a yawn. “It won’t be horrible.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It could be.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll be there. I’ll help you.” He fell silent for a time.
Then his eyes came to life again, and he laughed. “Before you arrived, Durian
was filling my ear about Tsecha. Your old teacher’s causing quite a stir,
apparently. He took one of the embassy triple-lengths out for a spin a few
weeks ago. Problem was, nobody knew he could drive. He got as far as
Minneapolis before a Service-idomeni pursuit team caught up to him and herded
him back to Chicago. They had a hell of a time hushing it up. That’s all the
anti-idomeni faction needs to hear is that the ambassador flits unguarded
through the provinces.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani chuckled as well. “You’re in for it now! Sounds like he
hasn’t changed. He used to like making himself up as a human in Rauta Shèràa.
He even pulled down a job as a Consulate tour guide for a few days. Nobody
could tell—his customers kept asking him what colony he was from.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh shit, I’d forgotten about that. One more thing to worry
about—what joy.” Evan’s expression grew wistful. “Seems odd, calling him <i class="calibre4">Tsecha</i>.
We knew him as <i class="calibre4">Nema</i>. I still think of him by that name.” He looked at
Jani, his eyes narrowing. “He liked you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yep.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He thought you were special.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Uh-huh.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He had plans for you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Evan, if you have a point to make, please do so.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. No. Just rambling. Exhausted.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Too much to drink.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hmm.” Worry clouded his features for a moment. “How do you
feel?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you sure? You look ill.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Thanks.” Jani rubbed her stomach. It had started to ache.
“I just ate too much.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We’ve had a few nasty new bugs crop up in the Outer Circle
over the past few years. Maybe you should see a doctor.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">No</i>.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan held up his hands in surrender. “Ok, ok. Sorry I
mentioned it.” He struggled to his feet, then helped her gather her bag and
case. “Cabin’s to your liking, I hope? Your clothes?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Nothing fits, Evan.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Really?” He circled her, studying her in a way not entirely
objective. “I did my best. Took your measurements from your old ID and turned
it over to my tailor. She seldom errs.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She made up for lost time.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I disagree. This dress is perfect.” He chucked her under
the chin. “Goes with the face.” His hand lingered near her cheek. “I’m getting
used to it. It fits you. Very ‘Queen of the Nile.’” He hesitated, then leaned
close and hugged her lightly, as though he feared she’d pull away. “We’ll be
fine. You’ll see.” His breath smelled of wine; his neck, of the
haygrass-scented cologne he’d always favored. Jani broke the embrace before she
wanted to and rushed out the door before he could say good night. She walked
back to her cabin in the grip of the sensation that she’d just skimmed over a
land mine.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I have to play this at arm’s length</i>. She hated to
admit how good it felt to talk to Evan, to someone who knew the long-submerged
Jani Kilian and, if outward signs could be believed, still cared about her as
well. It wouldn’t take long to become used to nice dinners and pleasant
conversation again. <i class="calibre4">And anything else that might reasonably follow</i>.
Soon, the roots would go so deep that when the time came to cut and run, she’d
be fixed in place by indecision and fear of what she would lose. <i class="calibre4">I can’t
afford to relax</i>. Especially now, with Ridgeway watching her every move.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She turned the corner in time to see her steward emerge from
her cabin.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ma’am?” He brushed a hank of hair from his sweaty brow.
“There’s a problem with the climate control on this deck. I’ve notified
Environmental, but they may not be able to return it to full function until we
stop at Padi.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh please!” Jani sagged against the wall. She looked at the
name tag on his left breast pocket. “Mister Ostern. Can’t this wait until
morning?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ostern thrust a small touchbox toward her. “Oh, everything’s
under control for now, ma’am. I’ve jury-rigged a bypass.” His face glowed with
pride. <i class="calibre4">Look what I made, Mommy</i>!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani accepted the small device with the hesitation of
someone who’d learned long ago there was no such thing as “free.” She looked
again at Ostern, shifting from his blinding smile to his eyes. Dark brown, like
chocolate. A warm color, normally. When brown eyes chilled, the cold came from
within.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her steward had cold brown eyes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I can show you how it works, if you like?” Ostern’s voice,
a pleasant tenor, still sounded boyish, but the examining look he gave the
documents case aged him several stony decades.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, Mister Ostern, it’s all right.” Jani hoisted the case
and, smiling sweetly, pushed past him and palmed her way into her cabin.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you sure, ma’am? I—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s all <i class="calibre4">right</i>,” she said as the door slid closed.
“I think I can figure things out.” She paused in the entryway and sniffed the
air. It did smell vaguely metallic and dusty, as though various things had gone
<i class="calibre4">plonk</i> in the depths of the ventilation system.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She removed her shoes. Blessedly barefoot, she knelt in the
middle of the sitting room and positioned Ostern’s little box on the carpet in
front of her. Using one of the spindly heels like a hammer, she smashed the
device to bits.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
After she tossed the fragments down the trash chute, Jani
rooted through her duffel. She pushed aside her magnispecs, assorted scanpack
parts twined through a holder of braided red cloth, broken UV styluses, and
cracked touchpads, until she reached the scanproof false bottom, beneath which
lay her shooter and her devices.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her sensor looked like a UV stylus, except that the light at
its pointed end blinked yellow instead of blue, and it had cost more than such
things did when purchased through the usual channels. <i class="calibre4">One does what one has
to</i>. As long as she’d never hurt anyone but herself, what difference did it
make?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She flicked the device on. Holding it before her like a glow
stick, she took a turn about the sitting room. <i class="calibre4">If I were an insect, where
would I hide</i>?
</p>

It took the better part of an hour to locate the bug, lodged
in the bedroom temperature control panel. Bold of Ostern to set it up so she
would activate it herself with his cunning control box. She wrapped the tiny
plastic cylinder in a strip of antistatic cloth and buried it in the depths of
her duffel. A simple listening device, rather than a full sight-and-sound
recorder. In that respect, Ostern had disappointed her. She would have expected
more from someone with such cold eyes.

Jani ferreted through her cabin a second time. Reasonably
certain she had done all she could to ensure her privacy for the ship-night,
she undressed. Her stomach ached in earnest now. Her skin felt clammy. She
opted for a hot shower in an effort to warm up, and to wash the food odors from
her hair. She stood under the water stream until the utilities monitor squealed
an imminent cutoff. Then she toweled slowly, all the while thinking about the
garage guy. He’d had stomach problems, too. Nausea. Sweats.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Last thing I need is personal experience with the latest
colonial epidemic</i>. They’d become more and more common in the last few
years—planet-specific infections which, in all the cases Jani heard about, led
to long hospital stays and vague medical mumblings about mutating viruses.
Well, she’d had enough doctoring to last a lifetime. Anything she had, she’d
fight off herself.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She trudged into her bedroom and dug one of her Service tee
shirts out of the warren of drawers. The white polycotton still looked new,
even after twenty years. <i class="calibre4">I remember when I got you</i>. She pulled the
use-softened shirt over her head. <i class="calibre4">I’d just graduated OCS, surprising one and
all</i>. She smiled. Some memories, at least, were pleasant.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">One of Six for tongue of gold, Two for eyes and ears</i>.
</p>

“It had nothing to do with brains or rank, Ridgeway—we were
all on the ball back then,” Jani explained to her furniture. “And we needed our
little games, to keep us sane.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Three and Four for hands of light, Five and Six for
Earthly might</i>. They each had their own special method for keeping the
Laumrau Academy administrators off-balance. Senna and Tsai possessed their
“hands of light,” their talents as musicians, which ranked them quite highly as
far as the born-sect idomeni were concerned. Aryton’s and Nawar’s “Earthly
might” derived from their Family connections.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But Hansen was the <i class="calibre4">Ambassador</i>,” Jani said, stressing
the point for the benefit of her bedclothes. True red hair was extremely rare
among the idomeni’s major sects. Red in all its variations being a holy color
to them, they were inclined to believe any human gifted with such to be
possessed of talents in many areas. When trouble brewed in Rauta Shèràa’s human
enclave, Hansen was always called in to help lift the pot off the boil.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And I always went with him.” Kilian, with her knack for
understanding idomeni languages and mannerisms, and her ability to fade into
the background. <i class="calibre4">I’ll talk</i>, Hansen had always told her, <i class="calibre4">you just watch</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You get used to watching.” She crawled into bed, duffel and
documents case in hand. She unlocked the case and pulled out black-jacketed,
confidential Interior files, arranging them in a semicircle on the blanket.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Then she activated her scanpack, her original, unadorned,
idomeni-made unit, awarded to her personally upon her graduation by the being
who now called himself Tsecha. Then, as now, he served as chief propitiator,
the religious leader of his sect. Thus empowered, he had compelled his
order-loving, xenophobic people to accept his dictum that humanish be allowed
to school with them. Work with them. Even live with them, if isolation in an
enclave two kilometers from the farthest outskirts of Rauta Shèràa could be
called “living with.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Scores of humans had studied various subjects at the
rigorous Academy. But the Six had been favored, and Jani Kilian and Hansen Wyle
had been the most favored of all.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Not that she recalled any envy. If anything, her fellow
documents trainees had been happy to allow her and Hansen the bulk of Nema’s
attention. And of his plotting. <i class="calibre4">Grim Death with a Deal for You</i>, Jani had
dubbed him, much to Hansen’s delight. But he had been theirs to laugh at. After
all he’d put them through, they’d felt entitled.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">And now he’s back</i>. And still causing trouble,
according to Evan. <i class="calibre4">If all you think he’s interested in is the occasional
joyride, have I got news for you</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She cracked a file seal and glanced down the table of
contents of an Interior budget report, then scanned the file. Her ’pack worked
without a hitch, as it had since the day she’d received it. “Anytime you want
to compare equipment, Mr. Ridgeway, you just say the word.” With that, Two of
Six, the Eyes and Ears, set to work.
