<p class="NormalFirst">
“Of course you understand, nìRau, that much depends on
your people’s willingness to let bygones be bygones.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha looked Prime Minister Cao in the face as he tried to
discern her meaning. The female raised her chin in acknowledgment of his
attention and curved her lips without baring her teeth. On its own, Tsecha had
learned over the past weeks, the expression meant nothing. Cao always smiled.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I do not understand you, <i class="calibre4">nìa</i>,” he said. “Please
explain.” The female’s lips curved even more. <i class="calibre4">Yes, it is good to have called
her nìa</i>. The only other humanish female he had called by the informal title
in this damned cold city had been Hansen Wyle’s daughter. <i class="calibre4">And she had not
smiled</i>. She had shouted, in fact, and stamped her foot. Her voice had grown
so loud, embassy Security had wanted to expel her from the grounds. How the
young one had cried out. <i class="calibre4">I’m not my father</i>!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Bygones, nìRau.” Cao shifted in her high seat. Like
Ulanova, her legs were not long enough to provide adequate counterbalance. She
tottered and had to grab hold of the sides of her seat cushion to keep from
falling. “We will ignore the fact the Elyasian Haárin are trying to monopolize
transport refitting in most of the Outer Circle. In return, your colonial
Council will cease its attempts to secure full and unrestricted access to
Padishah GateWay.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha nodded, his eyes fixed on the Prime Minister’s
pale-knuckled grip on her chair. <i class="calibre4">If I moved quickly, she would tumble to the
floor</i>. He had done such once before, to Enne-gret Nawar, during the young
male’s Academy entrance interview. As Tsecha remembered, Nawar had not thought
it very funny. <i class="calibre4">He bruised his hip, and split his trousers</i>. Nervous
humanish, he had learned, needed to be treated carefully.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau? Are you listening to me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha studied Cao’s round, golden face. Her eyebrows, thin
as black pencil lines, had drawn down in puzzlement. “Yes, nìa,” he replied.
“You will allow my Sìah Haárin to continue to attempt to rebuild your most
aged, unspaceworthy ships. In exchange, we the idomeni are to surrender in our
efforts to gain more direct access to our Vren colonies, which suffer already
from undersupply and dwindling populations. Thank you. Most generous. My
Oligarch will be most pleased.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Why do you not say what you mean? Why do humanish never say
what they mean? As long as Padishah remains secure, you will have no worry that
Haárin will try to settle on Nueva Madrid. Your Service hospital will remain
safe from our observation. Your experiments will remain safe from our
observation.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We have known of the Ascertane work for some time, Your
Excellency.” Tsecha’s use of Cao’s humanish title upset the female, as he knew
it would. Every trace of her constant smile disappeared. “We also know of the
attempts John Shroud’s colonial hospitals have made to recruit Haárin into
other medical studies. So much have our outcasts been promised in return for
their help. Access to business. Status. I wonder how Albino John is able to
offer so much. I wonder who allows Albino John to offer so much.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The pleasing color drained from Cao’s face, changing from
Sìah-like gold to the bloodless sand of her tunic. Shards of pure color, formed
by the lake reflection through idomeni window glass, danced over her face as
though small flares burned beneath her skin. The lake itself, Tsecha could see,
had calmed, the shore ice that had been shattered by the storm re-formed. A
pleasing observation, a well-ordered reflection of the room itself: large,
lake-facing, quiet, with chairs even a humanish would consider tolerable. With
the exception of his own rooms, Tsecha favored this place most in all the
embassy.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Cao breathed in deeply. “Since we’re being so open and
aboveboard with one another, nìRau—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Ah, sarcasm</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—perhaps you would be so good as to explain your actions of
the past few days?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Actions?” Tsecha folded his arms into the full sleeves of
his overrobe and shifted on his low stool. Had they found traces of his
presence in the Exterior skimmer? Clothes? Hair? Skinprints? <i class="calibre4">But I took such
care</i>. Would they be watching his hiding places tonight? <i class="calibre4">But I have so
much to do</i>!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The Exterior Minister has complained to me—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha held his breath.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—of your surprising attitude toward our requests for
information concerning Haárin soil- and water-treatment systems in our Outer
Circle. The reluctance of your Oligarch, of your Council and Temple, didn’t
surprise us, but we expected more of you, nìRau. Considering your history of
kindliness toward us, even during difficult times, we find this sudden lack of
cooperation on your part most unsettling—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha watched the lake shimmer in the cold sunlight like
metal foil. <i class="calibre4">My two favorites would have liked this room, I think</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—if not downright alarming.” The Prime Minister paused to
dab perspiration from her forehead with a wisp of white cloth she then tucked
inside her tunic sleeve. Outside, the air could freeze one’s blood, but the
temperature inside the viewing room was most pleasant. “This place is set up to
remind you of Rauta Shèràa, nìRau?” she asked as she made a small gesture
toward the sand-painted walls and sun-stone-tiled floor.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, nìa.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Even the temperature?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you not find it comforting?” Tsecha inhaled deeply of
the hot, dry air. “I was told you would find it comforting.” He had, of course,
been told no such thing. The ease with which he lied about such an
inconsequence was lessened by the fact that, for the first time since he had
arrived in this frozen city, he felt truly warm.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Cao patted her forehead again. “I think you are pulling my
leg, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Pulling your leg, nìa?” Tsecha looked at the female’s
cloth-covered limbs in alarm. He and the Prime Minister sat an arm’s length
apart—he had not touched her! “I only enjoy the warmth,” he admitted, “and wish
you to think I provided it for you.” A humiliating admission, perhaps, but
better that than to suffer such disorder!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Cao drew up straighter in her seat. “The strategy sounds
familiar. Which of your Six taught you that particular lesson, nìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My Tongue taught me most.” Tsecha bared his teeth. “My
Hansen.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I should have guessed,” Cao said, frowning. “I watched
Hansen Wyle grow up. He schooled with my children. With all due respect, nìRau,
learning humanish ways from that man was the equivalent of learning table
manners from Vlad the Impaler.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Vlad, nìa?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“A long-dead dominant of ours. You would have considered him
most disordered.” A shadow of a smile revisited Cao. “Do you think much of
Hansen these days, nìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha felt the female’s stare, chilling where the sun had
so recently warmed. “I think of Hansen every day, nìa.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you think of any of the others, as well?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">To lie successfully, Nema, you need to think of it as a
game</i>. His Hansen had sat in a room much like this one. Fallow time had come
to the north-central regions; rain and wind had beaten against the window like
souls screaming for mercy. <i class="calibre4">The best human liars think of it as a game. Don’t
think of the importance of what you’re saying, or what you’re trying to
accomplish—if you do that, you’ll lose. It’s just a game Nema. Just a game</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, nìa,” Tsecha answered, “I think of no other.” <i class="calibre4">I am
as a young one, playing my game</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Exterior Minister Ulanova believes otherwise, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">A good liar knows how to use truth, Nema. He realizes its
value better than anyone</i>. “My Anais, nìa,” Tsecha said, “has much of which
to worry. Much which gives her trouble.” He bit his lip to avoid baring his
teeth as his Lucien’s stiff posture at the theater sprang up from his memory.
“The youngish lieutenant. Pascal.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.” Cao’s look held surprise. “Well, if <i class="calibre4">you</i> can
figure out what’s going on, someone had better have a talk with our Anais, and
soon.” She slid carefully off her seat. The click of her shoes on the bare tile
echoed within the room. “I must go, nìRau. Time for my staff to begin the dance
with your staff, I suppose. As usual, I have had an interesting time.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha followed Cao out of the room. In the hall, Sànalàn
appeared from the shadowed interior of a side hall and took over the escort
duties. Blessedly alone, Tsecha hurried back to his rooms. The time for
midevening sacrament was fast approaching, and he had much for which to
prepare.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He stripped off his clothing as soon as his doors slid
closed and hurried to the sanitary room for a quick laving. Even as water
dripped from his soaked head, Tsecha rummaged through his clothing cupboard for
that which he needed for his evening’s work: the silkweave cold-weather suit
which would fit under his clothes like skin and the battered bronze-metal case
containing other lessons learned from war.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha finished dressing. On its cupboard shelf, the metal
case awaited his attention. He lifted it, its weight as nothing in his hands,
and dumped its contents onto his bed. The two thin Vynshàrau blades he strapped
over the sleeves of his coldsuit. The Pathen Haárin shooter he shoved into a
pocket in the coldsuit’s front. The weapon bulged from his chest as a second
heart, but it would be most easy to reach if it proved needed. This he knew
from experience.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
With an ease he knew would have surprised his Lucien, Tsecha
stowed supplemental shooter power packs and assorted scanning and blocking
devices within other pockets in the suit. Shielded by the special polymer
weave, his weapons would fail to activate embassy scanners. <i class="calibre4">I am most as
Haárin</i>. He had felt such during the war, when he had allowed Hansen to
persuade him to have the suit made. The materials were meant to be used in
weapons-systems construction only—the fact a chief propitiator caused them to be
used in ways not their own moved beyond disorder and into chaos.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I have always been as Haárin</i>. Tsecha pulled on a
fresh overrobe, then sat in his favored chair. <i class="calibre4">Because of such, I understand
my Captain</i>. After a time, room illumins lulled by stillness darkened to
thin half-light. Tsecha felt along his sleeves and touched each blade in turn.
Through the altar-room door, he heard the soft sounds of his cook-priest and
her suborn as they readied midevening sacrament.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I feel no fear</i>. His hands were dry and steady. His
heart did not thud beneath his ribs. <i class="calibre4">Soon I shall walk into the night, as my
Captain did</i>. The thought should have sickened him, but it did not. He knew,
as she had known before him, that a disordered way sometimes proved the only
one possible.
