<p class="NormalFirst">
“NìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha suppressed a fatigued sigh as he lowered into his
chair. Since before sunrise he had stood, still and straight, praying before
the embassy’s dominant altar. Now he could see the sun through one of the
room’s narrow windows, risen three-quarters to prime, its reflection off the
lake a painful jolt to his long-closed eyes.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau? It is the Exterior Minister. Ulanova.” Head held
high in respect, Sànalàn, Tsecha’s religious suborn, stepped into his sight
line, a needle of light against the black stone of the altar wall. “She has
been scheduled, nìRau, but we may send her away, as before—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, nìa.” Tsecha used the gentlest refusal his tongue and
posture would allow, but the young female’s reaction showed that even so she
resented the interruption. Her shoulders rounded, her head tilted forward. Even
then, she stood taller than he, fine-boned as a marsh bird, her skin the sand
gold of her body mother, a central plains-dwelling Sìah. “This day, I must see
her, I think.” Tsecha continued to watch as his suborn’s shoulders slumped
farther. “You do not like her, nìa?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She is as a wall.” Sànalàn now straightened, raising her
cupped right hand chest high in question. “How can one promote order who
withholds so much?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Such withholding is much admired by humanish.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ah.” The narrow shoulders relaxed, the arm dropped to the
side. “Humanish admire odd things.” Sànalàn turned to lead Tsecha out of the
altar room. “Which explains much, and truly.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha held back argument and followed his suborn. She wore
a floor-grazing overrobe of bronze metalcloth; the material shone as a mirror.
The altar room’s bloodstone columns, black altar, sand-hued walls, the humanish
sun and lake themselves, curved across Sànalàn’s back as she walked, as though
the world itself clothed her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha bared his teeth in satisfaction. <i class="calibre4">Humanish grow
most still when they see my nìa</i>. Sànalàn’s hair, which matched her skin in
hue and her robe in shine, had been drawn back into the tight, braided knot of
an unbred Vynshàrau. Her eyes, Tsecha recalled from her embassy identity badge,
were large and green.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">They call her a walking Chinese porcelain</i>, he
remembered, thinking back to the humanish holo of the embassy staff’s arrival
ceremonies which he had watched. It pleased him greatly that humanish compared
his nìa to something of Mandarin, for such promoted connection between alien
and idomeni, a sense of order most greatly to be wished.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A sense of order which, Tsecha prayed, remained after his
meeting with Ulanova.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Sànalàn led him to the entry of one of his less favored
meeting rooms, but declined to open the door. “She will speak to you of Amsun
GateWay tariff issues.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“To be expected, nìa.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then there are the humanish sicknesses. She will ask if we
are, too, affected.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Ah, but that even I do not know, nìa. The Council I
represent will not tell me, even when I demand. They believe if they do not
speak of such sicknesses, those sicknesses will disappear. They have become
most humanish in that regard</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The suborn placed her left hand over her stomach, as
protection for her soul. “She has no right to ask of such things. As always,
she will give nothing, and expect everything.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha gestured in affirmation. “The humanish are afraid,
nìa. They do not yet understand the truth of what happens. So very few are ill
now, but—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If humanish took their honor in preserving order, they
would not so fear the death of the body.” The suborn straightened and began to
stroke patterns in the air, invocations against demons. So shaken was she that
she did not offer apology for her interruption. “Their fear of death will
destroy us all this time, and truly. They will strike at anything to save their
lives. It is a most ungodly thing.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha reached out and gripped Sànalàn’s hands, stilling
them. “You speak of things you do not understand, nìa. You were not born when
we first learned of the fear.” He longed to look his suborn in her green eyes,
but that would jar her to the roots of her soul, and such he could not afford
to do.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It is you who do not understand, nìRau.” Sànalàn spoke
slowly, boldly, as she tried to work free of his restraint. “So say the Temple.
So say the Council. You took in humanish, not knowing their fear. Trained them
in our ways, not understanding their fear. Paid almost with your life, for not
destroying that fear when the gods allowed you the chance. You understand
nothing! So say the Temple! So say the Council!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And what do you say, nìa?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Their words are mine.” The uncertain tremor in Sànalàn’s
voice betrayed her, but she was of Sìah, and Sìah were most stubborn. “You
understand nothing.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Slowly, Tsecha relaxed his hold on his suborn’s wrists. “But
that is why I speak to Ulanova, nìa. Because I who understand nothing
understand her best.” He spoke as humanish, with no gesture or change in
stance, his tone flat, allowing his meaning to hide itself between the lines.
Then he left his suborn to uncover that meaning as best she could and entered
the meeting room.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Inside the sparsely furnished space, Exterior Minister Anais
Ulanova met him as any suborn Vynshàrau would have: in the center of the room,
posture most straight, chin high, eyes closed. Tsecha had himself just spent
many humanish hours in that most uncomfortable position. He wondered how long
Ulanova had been standing such, or whether she had been sitting until she heard
his discussion with Sànalàn end.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Most humanish of me, to think in this way</i>. Cynical,
Hansen had called it. But the door to the meeting room was not soundproofed. To
the best of Tsecha’s knowledge, supplemented by the work of his Intelligence
skein, the Exterior Minister possessed no strong devotion to any deity and
little regard for the other ministers. <i class="calibre4">So what means this respect of hers</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha bared his teeth, extended his hand as Hansen had
taught him long ago, and summoned forth his best English. “Glories of the day
to you, Minister Ulanova!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The Exterior Minister’s eyes snapped open, widening even
more as Tsecha drew nearer. She tottered, took a step backwards to regain her
balance, then held out her hand as well. Her lips curved, but she did not bare
her teeth. “Glories of the day to you as well, nìRau,” she said, her low voice
pleasing to Tsecha’s ear, though not precisely respectful. “I am so glad we
could meet together at last.” The skin of her hand felt cool and dry, her grip
loose.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Cucumbers</i>. The harsh humanish sound pleased Tsecha’s
internal ear as Ulanova’s voice did the external, but why the peculiar word
should enter his mind now . . . ? <i class="calibre4">My handheld</i>. It
remained behind in his rooms—it could not help him now. <i class="calibre4">I am alone with the
wall</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova began the discussion, as was fitting. “Please extend
my thanks to your suborn for her assistance in arranging this meeting, nìRau. I
realize the notice was most short, and truly.” She led Tsecha toward two
metalframe seats placed in one corner of the room. “But we have received news
of an alarming nature from our Outer Circle agents. I felt you should be
informed.” The Exterior Minister worked onto her tall seat with difficulty,
appearing almost as a scuttling insect in the dark brown uniform she wore for
her embassy visits. She was only of average height for a humanish female, which
made her shorter than an adult Vynshàrau by half an arm’s length. “This news
may affect us both greatly, nìRau,” she finally said as she edged upright.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha found himself focusing on Ulanova’s feet, as always. <i class="calibre4">So
far above the ground</i> . . . “Yes, Minister. Sànalàn mentioned
your concerns of the Amsun GateWay.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I lied to your suborn, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Lied</i>. Tsecha tore his attention from Ulanova’s
dangling feet and looked into her face. “Lied,” he repeated aloud, as darkest
brown eyes looked at him in turn.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She’s alive, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She?” He felt a tightening in his soul and took deep
breaths to calm himself. “Of whom do you speak?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Of Jani Kilian, of course, nìRau. She was seen on an Outer
Circle colony by the name of Whalen’s Planet. It has one major population
center in its northern hemisphere, a town called NorthPort.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NorthPort, that is—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, nìRau, the site of one of the major Haárin
settlements.” Ulanova’s tone implied no apology for the interruption, as was
usual. “She was, in fact, on quite good terms with several of the Pathen Haárin
high dominants, especially a shuttle broker named Genta Res. It was he who told
my agent of the Captain’s existence.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha tugged at the sleeves of his overrobe. The loyalty of
Haárin—<i class="calibre4">tidal</i>, Hansen had called it. And yet . . . “I
suspect, Anais, that ní Genta was threatened perhaps with cancellation of
business permits before he felt the need to inform your agent of the existence
of the Captain. Allow me to save both our staffs much time by lodging my
protest of such with you now.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She is a criminal in your government’s eyes as well as
mine, nìRau. I thought this news would please you.” Ulanova’s tone grew harsh.
“I have known for some time that your search for her has spanned years.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">My</i> search, Anais. Not my government’s.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Is there a difference, nìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha smoothed the folds of his white overrobe, the red
trim of his cuffs providing the only true color in the drab surround. “I was
chosen to succeed Xinfa nìRau Ceèl as chief propitiator of my sect eighty-five
of your years ago, as a most young one. The Laum had just claimed power from
Sìahrau, and none believed Vynshà would ever rule over idomeni. Thus was I
chief propitiator when we were only of Vynshà. If we become only of Vynshà
again, chief propitiator I will still be.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau, I didn’t mean—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“To be in government serves only a purpose. For you as well
as for me, I believe, Anais, and truly.” Tsecha maintained an even, humanish
tone throughout his speech, ending by baring his teeth and sighing. An
advantage, perhaps, to being as a wall. If he had ever given this type of
speech in Temple or before Council, embellished with the full range of
Vynshàrau gesture and posture, so that every emotion and feeling of his was
revealed . . . <i class="calibre4">I would again be fleeing from mixed-sect mobs
demanding my life. Of that I am most sure</i>. He breathed in deeply in an
effort to slow his pounding heart. <i class="calibre4">My Captain lives</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Anais sat in silence. She had decorated her small hands,
narrow as Vynshàrau but lifeless white, with several large-stoned rings, which
she toyed with in turn. “We tracked Captain Kilian to a small Transport
Ministry hostel located in what one might generously refer to as NorthPort’s
business district, but one of Interior’s people beat us to the goal. My best
man was able to catch up with her and work on her for over a month. He is
positive we were put on the wrong scent, but I have been at this game longer
than he.” Stones flickered in the light. “Very soon, I expect to be proven
correct. We will have her, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha suppressed the urge to bare his teeth. Anais thought
herself so subtle. When she grew angry, she spoke in ways she felt idomeni
would not understand. <i class="calibre4">But I had my Hansen, and I knew my Kilian</i>. His
living Kilian. Quick, yes, and suspicious, as she was always. <i class="calibre4">Are you quite
sure you will have her, Anais? You have not the skill to read between her lines</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The Exterior Minister continued. “Later, my agents hooked a
red herring in NorthPort. She turned out to be an Interior staffer on holiday.
On holiday—in bloody NorthPort! Studying the Haárin, she claimed. Sent there by
Evan to cross me up, no doubt. Although I suppose it may have been true—she is
one of his Vynshà-watchers.” Ulanova’s mouth curved. “Vynshàrau, nìRau, of
course. Stupid of me. No offense meant.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But your very life is an offense, Anais</i>, Tsecha
thought as he nodded his acceptance of her apology. “So you suspect van Reuter
protects Captain Kilian now?” he asked. “Is that a surprise?” <i class="calibre4">It is not, to
me</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Considering their linked pasts, yes and no.” She pounded
her thigh with a jeweled fist. “If I only knew where he’d stashed her! That man
has allies all over the city, though with all those unanswered questions concerning
his wife’s death, perhaps not as many as he used to.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.” Tsecha nodded. He had read accounts of the death of
the Interior Minister’s dominant, in fact only, wife. <i class="calibre4">Such a disordered life</i>.
But there was blessed order in death, at least. “I rejoice in the Lady’s death,
for it has brought her peace, and truly. May Minister van Reuter find such
order as well.” He felt Anais’s eyes on him again, their glitter hard as the
stones on her fingers. Did she believe he wished van Reuter’s death as a
convenience for her? The thought angered him. “Thank you for the word of the
Captain, Anais. What else must we speak of? My time for first prime sacrament
draws most close, I believe.” He wished to be at peace when he took sacrament,
as well as later, when he planned. <i class="calibre4">So much planning—so many meetings</i>!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The Exterior Minister again worked her rings, studying him
through narrowed eyes. “There has been the first death, nìRau. On Elyas, in the
town of Zell, near the Haárin settlement. An older man, a shopkeeper. His family
was able to get him to the Neoclona facility on Amsun before he died. The
doctors there believe some type of environmental toxin is to blame, but no one
can determine what this man ate or drank or touched which could account for his
illness.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“This is the first and only death?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But not the first <i class="calibre4">sickness</i>, nìRau. There were two
more in Zell, a husband and wife, and a young man in NorthPort. The symptoms
were the same. Digestive problems and body aches, followed by mood
disturbances, psychotic episodes, rapid wasting. In the case of the young man,
his liver needed to be replaced.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova’s shining gaze moved about the bare room, focusing
on nothing. “We will, in deference to your sensibilities, refrain from asking
you to question your physician-priest skeins as to whether any idomeni have
likewise taken ill these past months. But we do need to know what types of soil
and water treatment the Haárin have in place in Zell and NorthPort, nìRau. We
need to know what sort of untaxed trade is taking place between your people and
mine. Specifically, are your Haárin selling food to my colonists? Food that is
proving to be more than an exotic delicacy, but that is poisoning them? I
realize your religions and cultures all dictate care and secrecy with regard to
the production of your foods, as they do with your treatment of illness, but we
need that information. You must comply with our requests. An order is required.
Through your Council, and coming from you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You know what the answer will be, Anais.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then we will expel the Haárin from the Outer Circle.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And we will expel humanish from Samvasta and Nèae, and all
will go as before.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We need that information, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You know it already, Exterior Minister. Do not come to me
for confirmation you have obtained from your own. Your doctors keep you well
informed, this I know, and truly.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, nìRau—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha bared his teeth quite broadly. “Ever since their
first work in Rauta Shèràa, your Neoclona doctors have worked as they pleased,
Anais. DeVries, and Parini, and your most excellent Shroud. You keep their
secrets from idomeni. Why should idomeni behave as different?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova looked Tsecha in the eye, her stare most steady.
“Because idomeni, I think, want what we in the Commonwealth want. A
well-ordered future.” She stepped down from her high seat. When she stood most
straight, she seemed not as short as Tsecha knew her to be. “This is what I
assume, nìRau. To the best of my knowledge, your government does not share your
vision of the future.” Her gaze probed like a physician’s instruments. “They
know what you believe, and still they sent you here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha bared his teeth. He welcomed the opportunity for open
discussion, the chance to speak as idomeni. “Yes, Minister. All on Shèrá know
my beliefs.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That if we share worlds long enough, eat the same foods,
drink the same water, we will begin to change? The idomeni will become more
human and the human will become more idomeni.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Until, in the end, we will be as one people, Minister. Such
is order, greatly to be wished. All the same, in the end.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hybridization.” Ulanova’s eyes dulled. “John Shroud
testified before the Cabinet last month on just that subject, nìRau. He
believes the idea laughable.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Does he, Minister? That is most interesting. When he
labored in his basement in Rauta Shèràa’s humanish enclave, he believed quite
differently. So often would he visit me at the Academy, to argue the beliefs he
does not believe in anymore.” Tsecha remembered warm breezes, the sweet odor of
lamptree, the raised voices. “Even then, his research told him the benefits of
combining. Of hybridization. ‘Humans could live two hundred years, nìRau,’ he
would tell me. How pink his face grew as he spoke. Even now, I remember the
pinkness.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova stood very straight and crossed her arms. “But his
research led nowhere, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Indeed, Minister?” Tsecha gestured in disregard. “This is
why he and DeVries and Parini govern their hospitals as Oligarchs, watch over
the Commonwealth as propitiators? Because John’s research has led nowhere?” His
hands trembled. Such joy to be had, in open disputation. “But he still thinks
his new humans could be changed as he wills, and remain most as human. He
thinks he can take the advantages of combining and give nothing in return. So
little he understands of order. So little he has always understood.” An even
more joyous thought occurred to him. “Did you ever ask John Shroud, Minister,
whether <i class="calibre4">he</i> knew where Jani Kilian is?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova closed her eyes and began to massage her forehead.
“Doctor Shroud assured me—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Did he, Minister!” Such joy Tsecha felt, he interrupted
without apology. “So well John assures. He assured my Hansen, just before my
Hansen died. And he assured me, just before the Haárin entered Rauta Shèràa and
the sect dominants demanded my death. ‘I do not have her, nìRau,’ he said. ‘She
died in that transport crash. Nothing left but ashes.’ Thus did John Shroud
assure, while in his basement, his new human healed.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ulanova’s eyes snapped open. “If my hunch proves true,
nìRau, and your Captain turns up, I will first use her to destroy Evan van
Reuter. Then, she will face court-martial, and if I have any say in the matter,
she will be executed for the murder of Rikart Neumann.” Her lip curled. A
humanish smile. The smile of a wall. “Ironic, if that augmentation which helped
her survive the crash only served to keep her alive for me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha bared his teeth. “My Captain was augmented for one
reason only, Minister. So she would be alive when I needed her. So she would
live until her time had come. Her time to succeed me. Her time to take my place
as chief propitiator of the Vynshàrau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Something shimmered in Ulanova’s eyes. Was it fear? “In your
own way, nìRau, you are as fanatical as our most radical religious leaders.”
Her tone hardened. “What you believe can never come to pass.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Such is as it will be, Minister. Whether <i class="calibre4">you</i> believe
or not is of no importance. You will come to accept or be left behind. As the
Laum were left behind, and as all will be left behind who do not accept order.
Order must proceed, Minister. Order is all.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It is good I understand you, nìRau,” Ulanova said softly as
she looked down at him. “Now, with regard to your refusal to supply information
concerning illegal Haárin trade, please allow me to save both our staffs much
time by lodging my protest of your behavior with you now.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Your protest is noted, Anais.” Tsecha remained seated, his
hands twisted through his overrobe to stop their shaking. <i class="calibre4">But my Captain
lives, as I prayed, so lodge your protests where you will</i>. Double meaning,
he knew, in those words. Between the lines. Hansen would have been proud.
