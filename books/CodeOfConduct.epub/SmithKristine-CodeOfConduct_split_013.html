<p class="NormalFirst">
“His troops would follow him anywhere, but only for the
entertainment value.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha stared at the sentence until his eyes felt
desert-dry. Finally, he admitted surrender with a rumbling sigh and reactivated
his handheld. The small unit had long since gone dormant; he had to rock and
jostle it before the blue activator pad glowed and the display lightened.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">You are as me, grown most old</i>. Tsecha entered codes
and file keys both by voice and input pad, pausing frequently to allow the
readout time to catch up. He practiced his English counting as the time passed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Then, one after another, the words scrolled across the
display, the looping curves and complex crosshatches of High Vynshàrau. Tsecha
savored each nuance, every shading. Even after so long, he found his self-made
dictionary most educating.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Entertainment</i>. He read the line again. <i class="calibre4">This
officer’s troops intend to watch from a distance, as though he walks a stage</i>.
That implied they did not trust him. A poor thing, such mistrust. A threat to
order. Why then did the Service maintain the officer?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Why did humanish do so many foolish things?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Aháret</i>.” Tsecha spoke aloud the Pathen Haárin word. <i class="calibre4">Why</i>?
An unseemly question in the Pathen tongue. It implied the gods did not know
what they did. He stared for a time at the bare, sand-colored walls of his
room. Sand—such a comforting hue.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">How I miss heat, and truly</i>. Heat, bright sun, and the
bloom-laden trees of home. Relasetha and ìrel, fierce yellow and blessed red.
The images he held in his memory seemed so much richer than the paper and paint
ones that rested within niches in his walls.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I came to this damned cold place for a reason</i>. Why
now did that reason seem as hard to grasp as Service English?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha toyed with his handheld. So much easier to grasp. And
so much did it contain. Notes, translations, and definitions of his three most
favored humanish tongues, English, French, and Mandarin. He ran a finger along
the unit’s scuffed, gouged black case. <i class="calibre4">So much we have been through—peace
and war, the death of that which I was and the birth of that which I became</i>.
He looked at the handheld’s screen. It flickered. The display fragmented. Half
the words lost all meaning, while some took on meanings quite strange. He bared
his teeth. <i class="calibre4">I say you tell me jokes to ease my mind. But my suborns call you
broken</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Once he had, with great reluctance, allowed one of his
communications suborns to attempt to transfer the knowledge in his aged device
to one of the new bracketed-neuron models much valued by Vynshàrau
intelligence. Tsecha had almost screamed himself when his unit whistled and
screeched as the young female attached the interphases and initiated
connections. He had torn it out of the transfer array just in time, she
admitted later. Any longer, and his old friend would have . . . would
have . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The connections had aged, the suborn said. The neural
sheaths contained too much plaque, there had been too much cell death. A
transfer was not possible. <i class="calibre4">At this time, nìRau</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
At any time.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">We have aged together</i>. He stroked the plastic case,
which felt warm and smooth as flesh beneath his fingers. <i class="calibre4">Perhaps together,
we were meant to die</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ah, you think of death again!” Tsecha rebuked himself
aloud, in English. The language worked quite well for such. Its sharp, throaty
sounds, aided by so much tongue and tooth, forced one to pay attention.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So pay attention to this.” He paged through the copy of the
Service Officer Fitness Assessment, combing for more sentences that would
challenge his knowledge and his repository. “The humanish think these words
funny, and truly. Why?” It crossed Tsecha’s mind that his hosts would be
surprised to find an idomeni studying the personnel files of active officers in
their military, but he felt it a point to be ignored. He wished to perfect his
English, and Hansen Wyle had told him much of the language’s meaning could be
found in such humanish government files as this, in places “between the lines.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">So shall I search. Between lines</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha put down the file he held and opened another, paging
through sheet after sheet until he came to the entry with the latest date.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“This officer should go far. I’ll drive.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha stared and studied. This statement, he felt he
understood. <i class="calibre4">Another incompetent—with so many, how do the humanish survive</i>?
He closed the assessment and set it on the table beside his chair. He would
have to remember to ask of his intelligence suborns where exactly they had
obtained these files. They had insisted most strongly that their infiltration
of humanish systems was not suspected. <i class="calibre4">But the humanish enjoy laughter so much</i>.
A game, perhaps? Tsecha bared his teeth. Such, he understood most well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He rose slowly from his rigid metal-and-wood seat, wincing
at the popping sounds his aged joints made. He twisted and stretched his spine,
worked blood and feeling back into his limbs. Humanish complained of
uncomfortable idomeni furniture, but pain kept one sharp. Such did all believe.
All idomeni, that is. Humanish were different. They could not accept the
mind-focusing ability of pain.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He padded across the bare tiled floor, the same soft color
as his walls. He opened a large wooden cupboard and stored his files in one of
the touchlocked compartments of which his suborns knew. Then he pushed aside
carved panels and etched veneers and opened a touchbox that contained things of
which they knew not. Inside rested a ring, twin to his own ring of station, and
a much thinner sheaf of documents.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha picked up the ring, held it under the light, savored
its glisten. Then he returned it to its resting place and removed the
documents. <i class="calibre4">Moragh</i>, he thought as he opened the file. <i class="calibre4">I must find a
humanish to tell me what means</i>, Moragh. He had already sought the meanings
of his Captain’s other two names and had come away from each quest still
wanting. Perhaps the key was in <i class="calibre4">Moragh</i>. There had to be some hint, some
foretelling, somewhere. Surely his Captain could not have faded away without
leaving some type of trail. Some type of sign for him, who believed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I fought the Laumrau for you. You are all that is order
to me</i>. Tsecha returned to his chair and paged through the pale blue Service
parchment. Long ago, some of the sheets had been stained by smoke, then by
flame-retardant foam. Their surfaces shone greasy grey and mottled in his
room’s sunlike illumination.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I paid much to the Haárin to recover these from your
Service base</i>. His debriders, dispatched to search the cleansing flames of
Rauta Shèràa for any paper they could find. <i class="calibre4">But all they found was this
small amount</i>—Tsecha riffled the few stiff pages—<i class="calibre4">because even your own
wished you erased</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Even though he knew the words as he knew his born-sect and
skein, Tsecha read Jani Kilian’s Officer Assessment.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Insubordinate. Typical dexxie know-it-all. Stiff-necked
colonial. Doesn’t belong in a uniform</i>. As ever, he could find no humor in
Kilian’s file.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A muffled, metallic sound stole his attention. Softly, at
first, then more loudly, the cloth-wrapped bell that signaled the cook-priest’s
visitation rang its dull, late-evening song. Tsecha continued to comb the
papers. Soon would come last sacrament, then sleep. He had not much time.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Where are you, my future</i>? He read the passages which
dealt with the Service’s search for their officer, their condemnation of her
disorder, their fear she would be found first by the Vynshàrau. <i class="calibre4">Mutiny . . .
murder . . . conspiracy . . . forgery . . .
assumed dead . . . body disappeared . . . door-to-door
search . . . no sign</i>. Acadian, she was, but later, they
searched for her there and found nothing. Rebellious, she was, but they
continued their searches to this day on their colony planets and found nothing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Words as written, ink on paper, Tsecha read and ignored,
continuing his own search for the sign from his gods, his own quest for his
Captain. In his own nothing. Between the lines.
