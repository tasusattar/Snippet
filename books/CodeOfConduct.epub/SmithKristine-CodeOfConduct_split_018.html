<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_27">Chapter 14</h2>




<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani sat at her desk, office door closed, curtains drawn
against the distractions of sun, calm lake, and cloudless sky. Her workstation
screen flashed in silence, its conversation input option shut down, alarms
muted. Feet propped on her desk, touchboard cradled in her lap, she leaned
forward to advance the shifting screen images with a stylus.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Then she hit the wrong section of the touchboard and dumped
herself out of a sensitive region of Commonwealth systems. Exasperated, she
leaned toward the screen too quickly and almost dumped herself out of her
chair.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Voice would go faster</i>. Jani berated herself as a
series of Lyssa’s files disappeared in a rainbow flash. Then she re-hacked her
way through the document tangle, once more by touch.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She had known dexxies for whom workstations provided the
bulk of daily verbal exchange. For some, it had been a conscious choice; for
others, it had just worked out that way.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Could have worked out that way for me. It’s easy, and
safe, and I could win all the arguments</i>. There were plenty of jobs out
there for a paper-savvy fugitive with an antisocial streak. She could have lain
lower over the years.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But she needed to hear real voices. Or, more to the point,
voices she knew to be real. Perhaps the difference was subtle, one for
philosophers. But she’d seen more than one augmented colleague done in by that
difference during her time on Shèrá.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Hearing things is a bad sign</i>. Seeing things was
worse. That meant all those neurochems whose names she kept trying to forget
were building up in her head in vain search of release, a condition more
properly known as augie psychosis. Sometimes reversible, if you excised the
implants in time, but most times, not. Shroud had begged her to keep watch for
the signs of impending problems, to come to him when she felt she needed
medical help.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Of course, her dear doctor had begged for a lot of things.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">What a couple we made—at the time, we added up to one
normal person</i>. Anyone’s guess who contributed the bulk of the normalcy.
Jani watched documents flick across the screen. She tried to avoid thinking of
her medical history, which seemed equal parts tragedy and farce. There had been
some good science in there as well, of course—it just got overshadowed. <i class="calibre4">I’m
a walking tribute to some amazing minds, I suppose</i>. Galatea to three
Pygmalions. <i class="calibre4">No, one Pygmalion, and two Frankensteins</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A nested display sharded into prismatic chaos. With a groan,
Jani flicked the workstation into standby mode. She walked to the window, swept
the curtain aside, then gasped as the molten glare of sun on snow blasted
through the glass and shocked her roomlight-adapted eyes. She buried her face
in the curtain, patted away the tears, then eased her lids apart and tested the
filming for the looseness that signaled stress fissures.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She blinked, waited, then looked out the window again. As
well as the lake and city skyline, her view included the Private House grounds;
snow-coated terrain banked and rolled around season-stripped native trees and
shrubbery, forming a landscape of white sugar and dark chocolate. <i class="calibre4">You need
to get out more</i>, Jani persuaded herself as she headed for the door.
</p>


<p class="separator">
<img src="conduct_scene_sep4-transpbg-2fh.gif" alt="Scene Separator" title="Scene Separator" class="calibre5"/>
</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
“Cabin fever, huh?” The Interior staffer who helped Jani
into the <i class="calibre4">one-size-adjusts-for-all-yeah-right</i> snowsuit nodded in
commiseration. “Bites us all after a few days.” He led her to the house’s rear
entry, cocked an eyebrow at her refusal of a skimmer for a trip into the city,
and shrugged at her determination to “just take a walk.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“January in Chicago—it ain’t for sissies,” he said as he
closed the door behind her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Neither’s taking a walk in some of the places I’ve lived,
mister</i>. Jani lowered the light transmittance of her goggles until her eyes
stopped watering. Each stride cracked like stuttershot as her boots broke
through the snow’s crusty white surface. Within minutes, she’d cut across a
flat, well-trampled expanse that would be a billiard table-like lawn come
spring, and entered a less-traveled area of sparse woodland and ravine.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Even when inhaled through her humidifier mask, the air
possessed a peppermint clarity. With every breath she drew, Jani felt her head
grow clearer. After weeks of recycled ship and station air, she grappled with
the urge to strip off her constrictive headgear and feel real wind in her face
again. Then she checked the weather sensor on her right sleeve. <i class="calibre4">Windchill—forty-nine
below. Cancel the blow for freedom</i>. Even after years of adjusting to their
quirks, she didn’t trust her revamped nerve endings’ ability to warn her of
impending frostbite.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The landscape glittered with fairy-tale desolation. She
bounded over fallen trees and ambled down the ghosts of trails. When a squirrel
darted into her path, then stopped short, tail twitching, she rummaged through
the pockets of her community snowsuit in case someone had left something edible
behind.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hang on,” she said to the creature, which responded by
launching itself across the path toward the remains of a storm-shattered tree.
Jani watched it disappear just as her gloved hand closed over something
crunchy. “Success—you should have waited,” she called after the departed
creature as she examined the smashed packet of crackers. With the grace of a
beneficent monarch, she tore the packet open and sprinkled the crumbs near the
base of the tree.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her good deed for the day accomplished, Jani continued down
the path. Every ten meters or so, she’d glance up at the treetops and wonder
where Evan’s Security force had stashed the buggery. If her sense of Colonel
Doyle was as spot-on as she believed, someone was monitoring her heart rate and
blood pressure at this very moment.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The distant shooter-crack of snapping branches didn’t alarm
her at first. She assumed a large animal, some type of ruminant. Or perhaps a
member of the Interior grounds crew, who could fall into that category as well.
<i class="calibre4">Not nice—everyone here has been very good to you</i>. With the exception of
Ridgeway, of course. No one could mistake him for a cud-chewer. <i class="calibre4">Although the
cloven-hoofed part</i>—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
In the middle distance, hidden by trees, a high-powered
skimmer shut down with an insect whine. Jani executed an about-face and started
back toward Interior Private. She could just glimpse the house’s roof between
the trees.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My shooter is in my duffel, and my duffel is in my office.
Good place for it</i>. She ground her teeth and focused on the red brick
chimneys, poking up through the slate roof like feathered badges. A beautiful
house, really. Too bad she hadn’t stayed behind to take a better look at it.
Designed to appear hundreds of years old when it was really no more than twenty
or thirty—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Branches fractured again. Jani dived off the path and behind
a fallen tree.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">If that skimmer turns out to belong to grounds crew
clearing trails after the storm, I am going to feel mighty stupid</i>. Not to
mention look stupid. <i class="calibre4">Getting an eyeful, Ginny? Think Evan’s guest is a loon
yet</i>? She glanced around at the bare trees. No cover. No place to run. Not
that she could make any time through the knee-deep snow, anyway. <i class="calibre4">Anytime,
Colonel. Come collect the idiot</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She gloved through the snow for anything that could serve as
a weapon, but could uncover only brittle kindling. She waited for augie to kick
in with the familiar calming cascade, but felt only the dry mouth and roiling
stomach of growing panic. The air she gulped through her mask tasted only of
bracing sharpness. And through it all, the broken thought worked through her
racing mind, like subtle static, barely detectable . . . <i class="calibre4">I’m
not right—this isn’t right—it’s not working right</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her berries didn’t seem to be in season now. Who’d have
thought in the end even augie would have let her down.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A short distance away, snow crunched. Jani nestled closer to
the log, grateful for the shadowy color of her snowsuit.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The footsteps stopped. “Risa?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani, hands working under the log, paused in mid-grope.
She’d managed to half-bury herself in snow, uncovering a couple of small rocks
as a bonus.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Risa? I know you’re here. I saw you take a header.” Twigs
snapped. “You’re wasting time.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked up just as Lucien Pascal, dressed in full
Service winter camouflage, leaned over the log. “You have a lot of nerve,
coming here,” she said as she sat up, rocks clasped in still-buried hands. She
jerked her head toward the house. “You know you’ve been seen.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Depends who’s watching.” Lucien’s breath fogged the clear
humidifier mask. He smiled, which she’d learned on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> wasn’t
necessarily a good sign, and held out a mottled white arm. “Could you come with
me, please?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’d rather not.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien’s arm hung in midair. What did his eyes, obscured by
darkened goggles, look like now? Jani knew she’d see more warmth in the rocks
she held. “I wish I could say you had a choice,” he said, his voice muffled by
the mask. “But I’m afraid you don’t.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He was probably right. Without augie stoking her, Jani knew
she didn’t stand a chance in a hand-to-hand with him. She curled her legs
beneath her in a semicrouch and considered her options. <i class="calibre4">He’s got a full
head, fifteen years, and at least twenty kilos on me, he’s armed, and he has a
vehicle hidden nearby that he could use to chase me down</i>. Add to that the
fact that Exterior infiltration apparently extended to Private House as well as
Main. <i class="calibre4">They must have contacted him as soon as I stepped outside</i>. Which
meant he must have been waiting for an opportunity to get to her since she’d
arrived. <i class="calibre4">And he’s probably not alone—must be a backup out there somewhere</i>—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So?” A hint of self-satisfaction flavored Lucien’s voice.
“Are you going to come quietly?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
In reply, Jani hunched her shoulders and shot forward at a
forty-five-degree angle, cannoning into his midriff and pounding her
rock-loaded fists into his solar plexus.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien emitted a gratifying “oomph” as he stumbled
backwards, but his jacket, well-padded and lined with impact absorbers, took
the brunt of Jani’s blows and cushioned his fall. He grabbed her by the
shoulders before she could straddle him, rolled her, and rammed her to the
ground.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Something hard, large, and pointed impacted Jani’s upper
back. Her “oomph” came much louder than Lucien’s since her civilian snowsuit
didn’t come equipped with bumpers. Gold lights novaed and died before her eyes.
Seeing stars—amazing how damned literal that term was.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What the hell—” Lucien struggled to his feet and backed
away “—were you trying to pull?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The sound of his labored breathing wended through Jani’s
pained daze. <i class="calibre4">Took ’im by surprise on my own—augie, who needs you</i>? She
tried to raise up on her elbows, but slumped back as some invisible giant
planted his foot squarely in the middle of her chest. Then jumped up and down. <i class="calibre4">Me,
that’s who</i>. She attempted to draw breath through the suffocating mask, then
to tear the clear shield away, but an upper-back cramp stopped her short.
Vanquished, she closed her eyes, pulled in the occasional pained gasp, and
waited for the fire in her lungs to go out.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien made no move to assist her. He brushed snow and
dead-leaf confetti from his suit, freeing his shooter from an inside holster in
the process. “You aren’t going to try to jump me again, are you?” He approached
her gingerly, free hand extended. “Rolling around in the snow with you might
have its attractions, but it’s too damned cold right now.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sweet-talker.” Jani waved him back and rose as best she
could on her own. “Bet you say that to all the prisoners.” She turned and
kicked weakly at some dark ridging poking up through the snow, revealing the
embedded rock that had knocked the wind out of her. “Lead on, Lieutenant.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien stilled at the mention of his rank. Then he motioned
with his shooter for Jani to walk on ahead.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Progress proved slow. The trail sloped and rose; Jani’s back
cramped with every jolting step, every strained breath. For a time, the only
words spoken were Lucien’s terse directions as he told her which way to turn.
Then, as they approached the clearing in which he had stashed his skimmer, he
drew alongside. Jani noted he had holstered his weapon. “You were going to
brain me with a rock,” he said, sounding genuinely upset. “I stole underwear
for you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I wouldn’t have hit you hard. Just enough to slow you
down.” She swallowed a moan as her back seized. “Honest.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien cut in front of her and popped the skimmer passenger
door. The vehicle was a newer sport model: satin-finish silver exterior,
black-leather interior, and <i class="calibre4">very</i> low-slung. This time, when he offered
Jani his arm, she took it. “Anything broken?” he asked, as she inserted herself
into the cockpit.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shook her head, slowly at first, then more vigorously
as the pain in her upper back receded to a duller, more manageable ache. Augie
to the rescue. <i class="calibre4">Now you show up</i>. “I’m too old for this crap.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s what you get for jumping poor unsuspecting
lieutenants.” Lucien slammed the gullwing shut and hurried around to the
driver’s side.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Take your time</i>. Jani stared at the vehicle’s dash,
which resembled a GateWay-certified transport control array. <i class="calibre4">Not like I
could skimjack this thing anytime soon</i>. She lifted her arms as high as she
could, pulled off her goggles and mask, pushed back her hood, and worked a hand
through her matted hair.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien fell into his seat and yanked his door closed.
Security seals whunked and hissed; the changing cockpit pressure made Jani’s
ears pop. “Fancy skim for a looie,” she said, as he freed himself from his own
headgear and gloves. His mussed hair gleamed in contrast to the cabin’s dark
decor. “Surprised someone from the A-G’s office hasn’t rapped your knuckles.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien jabbed at the vehicle charge-through three times
before he hit it. “I have permission.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know. Saw you and your permission on the ’Vee last night.
You make quite a couple.” She mouthed an “ow” as the skimmer rose with a jerk
and banked sharply, causing her to ram against her unapologetic driver. “I
finally got the meaning of your little card,” she said as they flutter-glided
down a slope. “Your sailracers. Off to surf the solar wind. You’re trying to
tell me a certain someone was augmented.” Lucien jerked the wheel again, and
she banged into her door. <i class="calibre4">And if you think I’m going to tell you who it is,
you can go wrap yourself around a tree</i>. Hopefully, <i class="calibre4">after</i> she had
disembarked. “I’ve never been kidnapped before. Are you taking me to Exterior
Main? A stronghold outside Chicago? The next province?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien cocked his head. That was the only reply Jani
received as they hopped over a low fence that marked Interior’s boundary. Not
once during the transit did she see any Interior vehicles or staffers.
Anywhere. <i class="calibre4">Evan, we must talk when I get back</i>. When she got back—keep the
happy thought.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien’s wariness lessened as soon as they ramped onto the
Boul, the twelve-lane thoroughfare that had welcomed Jani so roughly the day
before. He drove fairly well. The skimmer’s proximity alarms didn’t yelp that
often, and he only passed on the right twice. After a few minutes, they ramped
down, leaving the pressing traffic behind. The snow had fallen on this quiet
world as well, but Jani could see from the bare sidewalks and roofs that staff
had already seen to the cleaning up.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien, too, eyed the facades of cream and light brown brick
and stone, tiny patches of manicured hybrid greenery filling the narrow spaces
between house and sidewalk. “This is the Parkway,” he said softly. “I suppose
you could call it a stronghold.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani recalled Minister Ulanova’s stern portrait in the Amsun
Station gangway. <i class="calibre4">I can’t say how much I’m looking forward to this</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
They stopped in front of one of the buttercream manors. In
the center panel of the double-wide front door, Jani spotted the gold-enameled
oval centered with the black double-headed eagle of the Ulanovs. As a uniformed
Exterior staffer hurried out to take the skimmer, she and Lucien disembarked
and made their way up the narrow walk.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The doors flew open. A dark-haired young woman rushed out
onto the landing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Lucien</i>!” She wedged between him and Jani,
imprisoning his arm in hers. “Where have you been? Milady has been calling for
you every five minutes—the hell of it!” She pushed Lucien ahead of her through
the entry, then tried to close it on Jani. “You go around the back,” she
snapped.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">No</i>, Claire, she comes in the front.” Lucien shook
himself free of his petulant escort and ushered Jani into the mirror-lined
entry hall. “Now go tell Her Excellency we’re here.” His not-so-gentle shove
propelled Claire halfway down the hall. “<i class="calibre4">Bâtard</i>,” she spit as she
disappeared through an open doorway, her kittenish face aged to cat by a nasty
glare.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My thoughts exactly,” Jani said as she turned to Lucien,
who had developed an interest in the gilt frame of a mirror. “Stoking fires
upstairs and down. You’re asking for trouble.” The dig elicited only a bored
shrug. “What does Ulanova want from me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’ll know soon enough.” Lucien’s eyes held the dull cast
of ice left too long in the cooler. The <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> seemed a long time ago.
A very long time.
</p>
