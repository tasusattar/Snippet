<p class="NormalFirst">
The frigid morning dampness seeped through Jani’s
weatherall as she hurried out of the charge lot. She jammed the notes from her
crack-of-dawn meeting into the side pocket of her duffel; as she did, she
quickly surveyed the scene behind her. Rain-slick skimmers hovered beside boxy
charge stations. Trickle-charge lights glimmered like distant stars. A single
streetlight bathed everything in a cold blue sheen. No movement in the
ice-light. No sound.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani took a step. Stopped. She could feel eyes follow her,
could sense their probing like a skin-crawl across her shoulders. She turned.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A few meters away, a feral cat regarded her from its perch
atop a discarded shipping crate. It stared at her for a few moments, then
poured to the ground and vanished into an alley. Seconds later, Jani heard the
scatter of garbage, followed by a strangled squeak.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Sounds familiar</i>. The poor mouse. It probably never
knew what hit it. Jani could sympathize. Her meeting had gone much the same
way.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">It’s like everyone’s forgotten Whalen’s Planet exists,
girly. Commercial traffic at the docks is down sixty percent in the last two
weeks. That’s six-oh</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">She trotted down a side street that led to the main
thoroughfare. Her right knee locked as she turned the corner, and she stumbled
against a pair of mutually supportive inebriates who had emerged from one of
NorthPort’s many bars.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
One of the drunks shouted as Jani disentangled herself and
hurried away. Something about how her limp made her ass wiggle. She looked over
her shoulder, caught glimpses of brightly colored ship patches and a
slack-jawed leer. She felt the heat creep up her neck and kept moving.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She entered the lobby of a hostel that catered to
merchant-fleet officers, tossing a wave to the desk clerk as she hurried to the
holoVee alcove. Several employees already sat on the floor in front of the
display screen, their positions carefully gauged to allow them a clear view of
the front desk.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">On the lookout for the manager</i>. Jani kept quiet until
she entered within range of the holoVee’s soundshielding. She knew an
unauthorized break when she saw one. “Is this it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
One of the cleaners nodded. “Hi, Cory,” she said without
looking up. “It’s the CapNet broadcast. It’s just getting started.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani did a quick mental roll call of the small group,
counting faces, uniforms. She didn’t know their names—she tried to avoid the
complication of names whenever possible. “Where’s the garage guy?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He’s still out sick,” the cleaner said. “Should be back
tomorrow. He’ll be mad he missed this.” The young woman grinned. “I’ll tell him
you asked about him. He thinks you jam.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani responded with her “Cory” smile. Quiet. Closed. A smile
whose owner would blush and keep walking. She leaned against a planter and
surveyed with satisfaction the lack of fuss that greeted her arrival. Yes, Cory
Sato, documents technician, had settled quite nicely in NorthPort over the last
six months. Jani Kilian had never seemed farther away.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Until her morning meeting.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Business has dropped over the side these past two weeks,
girly. NUVA-SCAN annex won’t answer our calls. Even the Haárin are complaining.
But you wouldn’t know anything about that, would you</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
An overwrought voice interrupted Jani’s troubled meditation.
“A great honor is being paid the Commonwealth,” the CapNet reporter gushed,
“opening a new and exciting chapter in human-idomeni relations!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Spoken like someone who has no idea what she’s talking
about</i>, Jani thought as she watched members of the Commonwealth Cabinet walk
out onto the sheltered stage that had been erected in front of the Prime
Minister’s palatial Main House. Steam puffed from their mouths. A few of the
coatless ministers shivered in their formal, color-coded uniforms. Chicago in
winter looked even less hospitable than NorthPort, if that was possible.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Treasury Minister Abascal, ever-flushed face glowing in
lurid contrast to his gold tunic, trundled to the podium “to say a few words.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where’s the ambassador?” someone grumbled.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He doesn’t come out till later—you want the poor old
bastard to freeze to death?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Never get to see him at this rate.” One of the day-shift
waiters checked his timepiece. “All fourteen ministers gonna talk—it’ll be
hours.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not all fourteen,” said the restaurant hostess. “Van
Reuter’s not there.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Really</i>? Jani studied the rows of faces, looking for
the one she knew. Had known. Long ago. “Too bad,” she said. “He’s the best
speaker of the bunch.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You like him?” The waiter glanced at Jani over his shoulder
and sneered. “He’s a Family boy nance.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He knows the idomeni,” Jani replied. “That’s more than you
can say for the rest of them.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t see him much since his wife died,” the hostess
said. “Poor man.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You hear about him, though,” the waiter muttered. “Nance.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
On-screen, Abascal finished to scattered applause and gave
way to Commerce Minister al-Muhammed. Jani leaned forward, straining to hear
the commentary over the buzz of multiple conversations. Commerce controlled
trade and transport schedules—maybe something al-Muhammed said would shed light
on the slowdown around Whalen.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Is al-Muhammed the ‘A’ in NUVA or the ‘A’ in SCAN?” someone
piped, drowning out the minister’s voice.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh blow</i>! Jani shouldered her bag and walked through
the middle of the huddle. “Al-Muhammed’s the ‘A’ in SCAN,” she said, bumping
the speaker in the back of his head with her knee.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He’s another nance,” griped the waiter.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Cory, I thought you wanted to see this,” someone called
after her. “You’ll miss the ambassador.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I have to go. I’ll catch it somewhere else.” Somewhere
quieter. She should have known better than to try to watch the program with
others. Some things needed to be studied in private. Pondered. Mulled.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">We’ve officially reopened relations with the idomeni</i>.
Jani rubbed her stomach, which had begun to ache. <i class="calibre4">Wonderful</i>. She walked
past buildings of black-and-yellow thermal scan-brick toward NorthPort’s
Government Hall. The elegant twelve-story edifice loomed over all like a stern
but forgiving patriarch, offering numerous types of guidance to his wayward
children. Audit assistance from External Revenue Out-reach. Documents
counseling from the Commerce and Treasury Ministry annexes. By all appearances,
family relations appeared very close.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Appearances, as the old saying went, could be deceiving.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Why you always hang about with the nances at Guv Hall,
girly? What goes on there so interesting you need to see it every day</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She increased her pace as she headed out of the business
district, monitoring her stride in shop windows and mirror-glazed brick. She
had only become aware of the hitch in her walk over the past couple of months,
and had attributed it to a combination of the NorthPort weather and a cheap
mattress.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Among other things</i>. Jani took a step. <i class="calibre4">Right foot
down</i>. Another. <i class="calibre4">Left foot . . . down</i>. She had to
assume that. She hadn’t much sensation in her left leg. Or her left arm. The
lack of feeling sometimes made quick movement an adventure, but she maneuvered
pretty well for a half-animandroid patch job. <i class="calibre4">And my ass does not wiggle</i>—she
glanced at her reflection—<i class="calibre4">not much, anyway</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Block after block fell behind as she tried to walk off her
growing apprehension. She passed warehouses, long-term skimmer charge lots,
then a three-hundred-meter stretch of sand and scrub before coming to the
houses.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The facades of the one- and two-story polystone homes would
have appeared familiar to most humans, but a careful observer would have
noticed the subtle alterations. Smaller, fewer windows. No doors opening out to
the street. Blank walls facing the human side of town. <i class="calibre4">For humanish ways are
strange ways, and godly idomeni avert their eyes</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The low clouds opened. Cold rain splattered down. Jani
yanked the hood of her weatherall up over her head, but not before looking
around to see if she was being observed. She wouldn’t be welcomed here. The
made-sect Haárin, like their more disciplined born-sect counterparts, preferred
that their humanish neighbors keep their distance.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Except when it comes to business</i>. The Haárin were
non-violent criminals and other idomeni social anomalies, their manufactured
sect the pit into which the born-sects dumped their misfits. Even though Jani
understood the Haárin better than most, she still couldn’t be sure whether they
settled on human worlds because they enjoyed aggravating their governing
Council or because they actually liked the neighborhood. They definitely
enjoyed learning concepts like float-rebound accounting. They liked dealing,
and possessed a disrespect for Commonwealth rules and regs that was almost
colonial in its fervor.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">They’re probably all at the gathering hall, waiting for
Tsecha’s speech</i>. The reopening of formal diplomatic relations between the
Commonwealth and the Shèrá worldskein, and the subsequent reevaluation of trade
and taxation laws, concerned them as much as it did Jani’s bosses in the
Merchants’ Association.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I foresee busy times ahead for documents technicians</i>.
Jani squinted as the rain pelted harder and thick fog wended around homes and
down the empty street. Then a shadowed movement in the murky distance caught
her eye; her stomach clenched as it always did when she saw a NorthPort Haárin.
Their born-sect forebears had been Vynshàrau and Pathen, and the strains had
remained undiluted. The approaching Haárin was rope-muscled, slender, and two
meters tall. His yellow-orange skin, which screamed <i class="calibre4">jaundice</i> to humans,
in idomeni reality marked the races that originated in Shèrá’s desert regions.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">It’s only Genta</i>. Jani’s anxiety subsided. The shuttle
dealer walked toward her with long, loose-limbed strides. His dark green
overrobe clung wetly to his matching belted shirt and trousers, the hem
catching on the fasteners of his knee-high boots. Clothing drenched, fine brown
hair plastered to his scalp, the Haárin appeared completely at ease. With his
narrow shoulders, age-grooved jowls, and wide-spaced yellow eyes, he bore more
than a passing resemblance to a bored cheetah.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Nìa Chaw-ree.” Genta crossed an arm over his chest in
greeting. His right arm, palm facing inward. A sign of regard, if not respect.
“You ar-re noth ath a holoVee, watching speeches? That is wher-re all idomeni
ar-re, watching speeches.” The English words tumbled from barely moving lips,
all trilled r’s and fuzzed hard consonants. “Insthead, you ar-re her-re in the
rain.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, ní Genta—I don’t like speeches,” Jani replied as she
returned Genta’s greeting gesture. <i class="calibre4">And I have some nerves to walk off</i>.
But a Haárin wouldn’t know a nerve if it reared up and bit him in the ass, so
no use mentioning that. “Why aren’t you in the gathering hall? Tsecha’s born
Vynshàrau—they’ve always been friends of Haárin. You might like what he has to
say.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Genta held a spindle-fingered hand to his face and brushed
water from his hairless cheeks. His stare pierced Jani. She, of all people,
should have been used to it by now, but the direct gaze of idomeni eyes, dark
irises surrounded by more lightly colored sclera, could still disconcert.
Looking strangers in the eye was taboo for all born-sect idomeni, but the
NorthPort Haárin were adopting the custom as a matter of good business. The
fact that it rattled the hell out of most humans had nothing to do with it. Of
course not.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I did not wait for Vynshàrau to tell me to live with
humanish,” Genta said, “and I do not need what Vynshàrau says now to work with
humanish.” Like all his fellow world-men, he became much more intelligible when
he had a point to make. “NìRau Tsecha is not for Haárin. He is not for
Vynshàrau, or even for idomeni. He is for something <i class="calibre4">here</i>”—he thumped the
middle of his stomach, where most idomeni believed the soul resided—“and to
fight for such does not extend GateWay rights or alter contract law.” With a
distracted gesture of departure, he started back down the street.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It will be bad for business,” he continued, his rumbling
voice deadened by the fog. “Bad, as it was before. Even now it starts—where are
all the ships these past weeks? No good can come from this. No good.” With
that, Genta disappeared into the swallowing mist, leaving Jani alone in the
rain.
</p>

<p class="separator">
<img src="conduct_scene_sep4-transpbg-2fh.gif" alt="Scene Separator" title="Scene Separator" class="calibre5"/>
</p>

<p class="NormalFirst">
Eventually, she returned to the human side of town. She
wandered from storefront to storefront, finally joining a small crowd that had
gathered in front of a communications shop. Every holoVee screen in the window
contained the image of Prime Minister Cao.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And now, fellow ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and
gentlemen,” Cao paused, drawing out the moment, “it is my honor and my
privilege to introduce His Excellency, ambassador of the Shèrá worldskein, of
the Vynshàrau and of all idomeni peoples—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sects,” Jani muttered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—Ègri nìRau Tsecha.” Cao looked off to the side and
extended her arm. “Excellency!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sensed the tension around her as, on the screen, a
familiar face came into view. Familiar not because of the Genta-like skin tone,
the same gold eyes and long, straight nose, but because of something deeper,
something older. She felt wet cold wind brush her face and imagined it drier,
hotter. Instead of damp mingled with the acid bitterness of skimmer cells, the
sweet odor of lamptree blooms filled the air. The crowd surrounding her towered
above her, wore flowing overrobes, and spoke in lilting rises and falls.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Eighteen years ago, in the godly capital of Rauta Shèràa,
when we both were known by the names we’d been born with</i>—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Dear-rest fr-riends—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
—<i class="calibre4">I almost got you killed, didn’t I, nìRau</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—it has been too long.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The recorded audience exploded into applause as the
ambassador raised his right hand above his head in a subservient greeting. The
red stone in his ring of station flashed reflected daylight like a small warning
light. As the clapping died, Tsecha bowed his head and continued his speech in
High Vynshàrau.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani positioned herself so that the crowd blocked the
subtitles. She watched Tsecha’s posture and gestures, the sweep and flourish of
the highly choreographed language, and intuited meaning the way a musician
discerned note, tone, and tempo. It had taken her seven years to develop the
skill; pride and respect for the language prevented her from playing ignorant
and covering it up. The Haárin had noticed her ability soon after she’d arrived
in NorthPort. Whenever their trade council experienced a communications
breakdown with the Whalen’s Planet Merchants’ Association, they always
contacted Cory Sato to help resolve it, a fact that only helped worsen her relationship
with her bosses.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani flinched as the woman next to her pointed to the
news-screen. “It’s so beautiful! That language. Those gestures. Like a kind of
dancing!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A man in a dockworker’s coverall shook his head firmly.
“Don’t trust them. None of them, not even the ones we got here.” He gestured in
the direction of the Haárin enclave. “Sneaky bastards. Don’t see none of ’em
here, do you? No, they gotta shut themselves away all private.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Tsecha’s the Pathen Haárin’s religious as well as secular
leader,” the woman said. “They’re required to gather together in their meeting
hall to listen to him. Then afterwards, they’ll pray.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani nodded in agreement. Genta had, in fact, committed a
serious breach of order by not attending the program. But even the most humanish-behaving
idomeni felt that acting one way while believing another was disorderly;
Genta’s cultural conditioning prevented him from hiding his displeasure with
his ambassador. Likewise, his council’s action against him would be very
public, and very swift. <i class="calibre4">If his delivery contracts are canceled, the MA will
explode</i>. And she would be dragged in to ladle oil over the whitecaps, sure
as hell—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Them and their prayers.” The dockworker glared at Tsecha’s
image. “Everything’s a damned prayer. Even their damned meals. Say it’s their
religion, but whoever heard of a religion where it’s a sin to eat in public?
With friends. Like normal.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The woman frowned at him. “Eating’s different for them. They
store food very carefully and keep records of where it comes from. They call
their meals <i class="calibre4">sacraments</i> and their cooks <i class="calibre4">priests</i>. They eat by
themselves and pray the whole time. Very ceremonial. Very precise.” She nodded
knowingly. “That’s how they honor their gods.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The Haárin honor money more than gods,” another man said.
“You can buy some of their blessed sacrament if you really want it.” He
grimaced. “Don’t know why you would, though. They season their food like to
blow the top of your head off. Even the sweet stuff.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sacraments.” The dockworker snorted. “Bunch of creeps. Talk
like they got marbles in their mouths, look at you like you’re dirt.” He walked
away, his expression stony. “Didn’t need any damned ambassadors for almost
twenty years. Why now?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Interesting question, sir—I’ve pondered it myself the
past few weeks</i>. Jani cast a last look toward the screen, taking note of the
ministers sharing the stage with Tsecha. Every face wore a broad smile. Well,
those expressions would be wiped out soon enough when they realized what they’d
let themselves in for. At least this time she’d be far enough away to avoid
shrapnel. For once in her screwed-up life, she’d stationed herself, as her
mainline Service buddies used to say, well back of the front.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The rain had turned to mist. Time to head back to the
Association tracking station she called home. Jani hurried in the direction of
the lot where her skimmer sat charging, picking up her pace even though her
back had begun to ache. Her bosses would soon be screaming for the official
morning docking numbers. She couldn’t afford to piss them off any more.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A shout sounded from behind. The pound of running feet.
Jani’s heart raced. Her breath caught in her throat. Then chill calm washed
over her, like an old friend resting a hand on her shoulder. She reached into
the inner pocket of her duffel. Her hand closed around the grip of her old
Service shooter. She turned, only to see the desk clerk from the hostel racing
toward her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jeez, Cory, wake up!” The young man slowed to a gasping
halt. “I need—to talk to you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani withdrew her empty hand from the duffel and tried to
smile.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Boy, you look wrecked.” The clerk’s voice dropped to a
whisper. “You get those old farts you work for through that audit ok?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“As always,” Jani replied.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You know”—he leaned closer—“there’s a doe here from
SouthPort Consolidated. Jammin’ blonde. She’s looking for doc techs. Pass her
exam, she’s offering Registry-level jobs.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The clerk rolled his eyes. “<i class="calibre4">You</i>, dummy! You’re the
talk of the Merchants’, my manager says. All the paper you vet is so clean, it
squeaks. Six months on the job, not one observation from Guv Hall. My manager
calls it a miracle.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My bosses call it something else</i>. Jani’s smile faded.
The word “verifier” hadn’t been said aloud at this morning’s meeting, but the
mute accusation had hung heavy in the air. <i class="calibre4">Government spy. They think I’m a
government spy</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
If they only knew.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani glanced down the street, where the crowd still gathered
in front of the communications shop. “I’ll think about it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The clerk sighed. “Yeah, well, don’t think too long. She’s
checking out tonight.” He shook his head. “Registry-level jobs. Just think.
Exterior Ministry on Amsun. Maybe even Earth!” He punched Jani’s arm.
“Registry—that’s the top of the tree!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I know all about the Registry, child—my name resides in a
very prominent place in that epic tome</i>. “Thanks for the word,” Jani said.
“I’ll give it all due consideration.” She left the clerk to argue with her
retreating back and ducked into the alley she always used to reach the charge
lot. Then her stomach grumbled, and she tried to recall what waited at home in
her cooler. <i class="calibre4">Cold air—damn, I need to buy food</i>. And all the decent shops
were in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani hurried out of the alley, slid to a stop, and scurried
back into the shelter of a doorway. The desk clerk was talking to an attractive
blonde. His new contact from SouthPort Consolidated, Jani assumed. Try as she
might, she couldn’t recall ever seeing that company name on any shipping logs
that had passed through her hands.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani studied the woman’s neat hair and stylish clothes, both
several GateWays removed from the best SouthPort had to offer. She watched as
the desk clerk nodded, then pointed in the direction of the alley.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She backed down the passageway, her sore back protesting
every stride. When she reached the other end, she looked up and down the
street, ducking into the shadows as a passenger skimmer drifted by. She
listened, until she heard only faraway street sounds and knew for certain that
she was alone. Then she ran.
