<p class="NormalFirst">
“Your government takes issue with the bidding, nìRau?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha remained very still in his low bench seat, conscious
of the sidelong glances of the others at the table and the more direct,
fear-filled stare of the man who had spoken. Humanish eyes. He should have
grown used to them by now. <i class="calibre4">But so much white—like death-glaze</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He crossed his left arm over his chest and lowered his chin.
“The bidding, we are most content with, and truly, Mister Ridgeway.” His voice
rumbled, even in both tone and pitch and, he felt, unaccented. He was most
proud of his English. “My Oligarch wonders only of the lapse in security. He
fears it happening again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway shook his head in a show of impatience, obvious for
even a humanish. “NìRau,” he said, “Morden nìRau Ceèl has our word it won’t
happen again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha remained calm as the other humanish at the table
shifted in their chairs. Some exhaled loudly. He stared openly down the large
wooden oval at Durian Ridgeway, but felt no pleasure as he watched the man’s
tired face flood with color. It had always been too easy with that one. “Yes,
Mister Ridgeway,” he replied, “but you also gave your word last year. And your
office gave its word last month in your name. You pledged your word to research
this company’s documents, and you failed. What value is your word, Mister
Ridgeway? I ask you that.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The room itself seemed to sigh in response. Then the man at
the table’s head, Deputy Prime Minister Langley, spoke. “In Durian’s defense,
Staffel Mitteilungen took us all by surprise, nìRau. They purposely delayed
obtaining their start-up registration until the end of the fiscal year. Many of
our new businesses do this for the tax advantage. StafMit did it in hope that,
in the flood of applications, the screening committee Durian chaired would miss
the fact that via a blind trust, Gisela Detmers-Neumann held a significant
financial stake in the company.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha looked directly into the Deputy PM’s eyes. <i class="calibre4">Dark
Langley, as the night is dark</i>. If they were as idomeni, Langley’s eyes
would look as two black pits. He sat rigidly, his seat, like the seats of all
the humanish, elevated above Tsecha’s. The positioning of the chairs, the
humans’ stiff, formal posture, were meant to display respect. But he had never
detected either the gentleness of friend or the wary regard of esteemed enemy
in any of those in the room. What could he sense? Fear? Definitely. Dislike?
Perhaps. <i class="calibre4">They do not want me here</i>. That was indeed unfortunate for them.
Here, he was. Here, he would stay.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Tax advantage, Mister Langley?” Tsecha placed his hands
palms down on the tabletop. Red bands trimmed the broad cuffs of his sand white
overrobe, making it appear as though blood flowed from his wrists. His ring of
station glimmered on his finger, the jasperite also reminding him of blood.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, nìRau.” Langley’s thick, black eyebrows arched with
some vague emotion, but he offered no accompanying gesture or change in posture
to indicate which it was. Puzzlement? Surprise? Or perhaps the man felt
embarrassment concerning the question? Who could tell with these government
humanish? Their faces were as blocks of wood, their gestures, when they
bothered to gesture, meaningless flailing. “Taxes,” Langley repeated. “The
saving of money.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ah.” Tsecha spread his fingers. Wrinkled. Age-spotted. He
touched a thread-fine scar near the base of his left thumb, the remains of a
blade fight with an esteemed enemy, now long dead.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">à lèrine</i>—the ritual combat that declared to all
idomeni the hatred between two. So many such bouts had he fought in defense of
his beliefs—the scars etched his arms, his chest and shoulders. They had
thinned and faded over time, as he had. He had grown so old, waiting. “Yes,” he
said, with a nod he hoped Langley comprehended. “I know humanish have great
interest in money, and truly. That interest has been displayed to idomeni in
times past.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The room sighed again, for those reasons all humanish knew,
yet would not speak. In an effort to placate, Tsecha bared his teeth to the
Deputy PM. Smiling, to humanish an expression of most benign regard. Why then
did the man squirm so?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We’ve been through all this, nìRau,” Langley said. Indeed,
he seemed most displeased. His jaw worked. He gripped the arms of his chair.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, Mister Langley, we have.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Our purpose today is to discuss the Vynshàrau’s reluctance
to allow StafMit the opportunity to bid for contracts to install communications
equipment in the Haárin settlement outside Tsing Tao.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, Mister Langley, it is.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Since Mister Ridgeway’s committee approved StafMit’s
preliminary registration, thus bringing them to the Haárin trade council’s
attention, I asked him here to—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“To <i class="calibre4">trap</i> him, Mister Langley.” Tsecha dropped his
words slowly, carefully, like stones into still water. “And to embarrass Mister
van Reuter.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Plink</i>! Ridgeway stared at him openly, unsure whether
to be grateful or to fear what could follow.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Plink</i>! Langley exhaled with a shudder, his anger a
solid thing that one could hold in the hand.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Plink</i>! The other humanish at the table stared at
their hands, in the air over each other’s heads, anywhere but at one another.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha pressed his lips together to avoid baring his teeth.
He most enjoyed telling humanish the obvious truths they so feared. It shocked
them so.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“NìRau, I would have thought this neither the time nor the
place, but perhaps—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha shut out Langley’s drone. He had heard the arguments
before at too many meetings, could recite them as he did his prayers. It would
have surprised the humanish to know if the choice had been his alone, Tsecha
would have allowed Detmers-Neumann and her fellow outcasts to welcome him to
this damned cold city, to sit and watch him speak to the shivering crowds. <i class="calibre4">But
when her first openness failed, she tried to worm, to sneak, to . . .
to</i> . . . Tsecha’s command of English failed him. He only
knew that blood had asserted itself as it always did. Gisela proved she shared
skein with Rikart, and truly. So, just as truly, would he never acknowledge
her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
His gaze flitted from one tense face to another, finally
coming to rest on the female sitting next to Ridgeway. Blood asserted itself,
or did it? He tried to will the red-haired youngish to look at him, but she
kept her eyes fixed on her lap. Angevin. What did such a name mean? <i class="calibre4">Not-of-Hansen</i>?
How much Tsecha missed her father, as well as the one who worked with him. His
green-eyed Captain.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">If they were here, what meetings we would have</i>! But
Hansen, Tsecha’s brilliant Wyle of the godly hair, was dead, and the man’s
daughter could not compare.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
And Kilian . . .
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha looked down at his mottled hands. He thought so much
of age lately. Death. All these meetings brought such thoughts. All this talk
with as-dead humanish was enough to drain the hope from any living thing. And
he had had such hopes once, had seen the future in two faces. But one was dead
and the other, according to the increasingly impatient word of all his experts,
had to be as well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But they never found the body</i>. Though his Temple
rejoiced in their belief that Jani Kilian had died in fire, Tsecha had nursed
the slight doubt he had sensed in the humanish soldiers who had told him of the
crash, grasped it like a handhold in a wall of sand. Had fire destroyed his
toxin? He hoped not, with each progress report he received with shaking hands.
He prayed not, over each of his six daily sacraments. With each bite of sacred
food, he begged the gods to answer him. <i class="calibre4">Send me my kièrshia, please</i>, he
wove his entreaty around Langley’s continuing thrum, <i class="calibre4">before they bury me</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
And when his Captain had returned to him . . .
ah, then, would there be meetings!
