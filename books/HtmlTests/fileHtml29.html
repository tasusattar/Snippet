<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_37">Chapter 24</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani punched her pillow and turned over. Again. Again. <i class="calibre4">I
will not look at the clock</i>. She looked. Oh-six-thirty. She’d have to get up
soon. The thought wouldn’t have seemed so daunting if she had managed to fall
asleep in the first place.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She rolled on her back and stared at the ceiling. Her real
limbs sagged into the mattress like stalks of lead, while the fake ones felt
the way they always did. She kicked off her covers, then rose in stages. One
leg over the side. The other. <i class="calibre4">Sit up. Wait for the room to stop throbbing.
Stand. Walk</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Showering proved a challenge. Her upper back, a skinscape of
green and purple centered by a fist-sized swelling, allowed movement, but drew
the line at assault by pounding streams of water. Jani faced the main
showerhead as she washed her hair and got cleanser in her eyes, thus scuttling
her films. By the time she emerged, eyes stinging and back muscles twitching,
her stomach had begun to ache. <i class="calibre4">Can I go back to bed</i>? She checked the
clock again. Oh-seven-thirty. <i class="calibre4">Nope</i>. She refilmed, threw on another
expensive but ill-fitting trouser suit, and was halfway out the door before she
noticed her comport’s blinking message light.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan had recorded the message well after their aborted
dinner. Dressed in pajamas, he sat hunched at the edge of his bed like a
condemned prisoner on his bunk. “Jan? I’m asking you, no, I’m <i class="calibre4">ordering</i>
you to stop. Just stop. Meet me for breakfast, and we’ll talk over the reasons.
But right now, as your minister, I’m ordering you to cease your investigation.”
He rubbed his face, pressed his fingers to his forehead.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Durian showed me some sceneshots, Jan. You and some punk
from Exterior. I don’t believe the things he told me about the two of you, but
judging from the lengths to which he’s gone already, I don’t think it’s a good
idea to cross him right now. He’ll do what he thinks he has to. That’s his job.
I’ll let him. That’s mine.” He held a supplicating hand out to her. “I love
you. I want to take care of you. Isn’t that enough?” The message ended in a
twinkling fade, like a dream.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sat on her rumpled bed, duffel cradled in her lap. “No,
Evan. It’s not.” She hit the touchpad and called up the time he had recorded
the message. A little after one.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Having second thoughts about bringing me here, are you?”
With equal parts alcohol and Durian Ridgeway fertilizing the seeds of doubt.
She hurried to the elevator, then rode down with her finger poised in front of
the STOP OVERRIDE pad, ready to block anyone else from coming aboard. She
didn’t want to share the car with anyone. Especially someone who wanted to take
care of her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani entered Angevin’s office to find her and Steve sitting
at the desk, drinking coffee and talking in low tones. Both wore slacks and
pullovers in shades of pale tan which, combined with their hair, made them look
like a couple of lit matches.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani allowed herself a small feeling of satisfaction. <i class="calibre4">Nice
to see the kids together again</i>. But an undercurrent of edginess and the
thick haze of multiple nicsticks prevented her from thinking all was well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin confirmed the prevailing mood. “The idomeni
ambassador tried to reach me early this morning. The House operator added the
notation that he asked for Steve as well.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve waved Jani a vague greeting, then busied himself
pouring her coffee from a disposable reservoir. “What do you think it means,
Ris? Think he’s upset we’re digging into his old paper?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani accepted the coffee with a grateful nod and eased into
a deskside chair. “If he was, he wouldn’t call you directly. He’d lodge his
complaint using proper channels. First thing you’d hear of it would be when the
Xeno liaison called you into the office and tore you a new orifice.” She winced
as she drank. The coffee tasted as though it had been filtered through a sock.
“The ambassador was close to Angevin’s father, I believe?” She looked to
Angevin for confirmation she didn’t need. “Maybe it had something to do with
that?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin scowled. “God, I’d hoped that had stopped.” She gave
Jani a tired look and shook her head. “He tried to hook up with me as soon as
he arrived. I don’t know what he expected. I told him, ‘I’m not my father,
nìRau.’ He said, ‘I know, nìa—Hansen is most dead.’ He’s so damned literal.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve rocked back in his chair. “That’s how their minds
work. I told you, if you don’t want to talk with him, I will. Knowing how blunt
he is, he’ll come right out and tell me what’s the problem. And we’ll proceed
from there. I were thinkin’ of callin’ him after the midmorning sacrament.
’Round ten.” He glanced at Jani. “Like to be there with me, Ris?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.” Jani choked down another swallow of coffee. “Thank
you. I doubt I’d do any good.” She ignored Steve’s stare, leaving it to blister
the side of her face. “We need to get to work. Let’s see your paper.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin crumpled a dispo and bounced it lightly off Steve’s
chest. “Tell her.” Her voice tightened. “Or I will.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve stood, stretched, and walked to the curtained window.
“Mind if I open this? Sun’s a bloody bitch this early, but I need to see some
light.” He swept back the drape, revealing the shimmering lake, clear sky, and
the sun hanging in the midst of it all like a self-suspending light set on
high. “Not that bad, is it, with the filters in the glass?” He took his time
pushing the drape into its niche.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Steve</i>.” Angevin reached for another dispo.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve thumped the pane with his fist. Once. Again. “Betha’s
gone, ok! No one’s seen her since last night. She never returned to her flat.
Her half of the papers are gone, too. I checked her locker. I checked her
cubicle. The office she used last night. So that’s it. No one’s seen her since
last night, and the docs are gone. What else do you want me to say!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh shit</i>. “It’s not your fault, Steve,” Jani said. “We
were both sure she would stick.” Considering the scenarios running through her
mind, Betha’s merely running off would be a relief. “Where’s your half?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My office. Locked in my desk.” Steve flinched at Jani’s
glower. “Didn’t want to be seen carrying them. Not with the lien and all.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Let’s go get them.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
They had to pass the Doc Control cafeteria on the way to
Steve’s office. The noise made them pause; the crowd drew them inside. As they
pushed their way to the front, sharp voices cut through the swell.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Son of a bitch—where the hell is he</i>!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh God.” Angevin gripped Steve’s arm. “That’s Durian.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
People turned toward them. A few pointed. The sound level
dropped as though someone had flicked a switch.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What the hell’s on, Barry?” Steve called out to the stricken
young man over whom Ridgeway loomed. “Someone forget to sign a req for toilet
roll?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A red-faced Durian Ridgeway pushed past bystanders. “Where
the hell is Betha Concannon, Forell!” Coffee sloshed and work clothes were
spattered, but no one made outraged noises. Everyone was too busy staring at
Steve. Behind Ridgeway, two fully loaded Security officers shadowed into view,
long-barreled shooters gripped in their glove-protected hands.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh fuck.” Steve took a step backward, his eyes fixed on the
weapons.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t run.” Jani made a grab for him, but he dodged with a
quick sidestep. “Whatever you do, don’t—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve shook off Angevin’s scrabbling hands and cut for the
door like a sprinter out of the blocks.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“—run.” <i class="calibre4">Right</i>. Jani spun back around, let her bag slide
to the ground, and took a step toward the nearer guard, who had raised her
weapon. She gripped the barrel with both hands, tilted it to the ceiling,
twisted it ninety degrees, jerked out and in. Gristly crunches cut the air,
silencing onlookers’ startled cries. The guard uttered a strangled half sob and
sagged to her knees, her nose smashed and streaming blood, her fingers twisted.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Back muscles screaming, Jani swung the heavy weapon to her
shoulder and aimed it at Ridgeway. Lousy weapon-handling on her part, but his
stricken expression was worth a few broken rules.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin waved and pointed toward the doorway. “Behind you.
Trouble.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shifted her stance to find Colonel Doyle sauntering
toward her. Behind the Security chief, onlookers scattered. “Your friend won’t
get far, Ms. Tyi. The elevators and stairwells are already locked down.” She
reached out. “Hand over that weapon—it is not a crowd-control device.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No,” Jani said, “it’s not. It’s a V-40 Long-Range. Combat
weapon. Enough power to punch you into the hallway and me through the wall if I
fire. Stupid choice for indoors.” She pretended to take aim at a planter. As
she hoped, people scurried, ducking under tables and behind chairs.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If you back around one more table, you’re clear to the
door,” Angevin said. “Do you want me to get the other one?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">No</i>!” Jani shouted. One V-40 was enough. Thing had a
kick like a skimmer head-on—it needed a strut support, damn it!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Just stand sideways like you’re doin’, and bend your back
knee a tad. It’ll brace you, Captain. You’ll be fine</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Thank you, Sergeant,” Jani whispered. She aimed the weapon
in Ridgeway’s direction again. “Now, we’re going to go somewhere and talk about
this.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Like hell we’ll talk!” Ridgeway pointed to the door. “That
bastard buggered paper with Betha Concannon. Now she’s missing. The time for
talk is over. I’m ranking documents examiner on-site, and I have cause. I’m
declaring anarchy rules now!” He turned to Doyle. “Order a door-to-door! If the
little cunt tries to bolt, shoot to kill!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Stop. Telling. Me. My. Job.” Doyle pointed an accusing
finger at Ridgeway. “<i class="calibre4">You</i> said the other Cabinet Doc offices were in a
panic. <i class="calibre4">You</i> said a threat to the Commonwealth existed. Now you’ve scared
off the only person in this building who could confirm either condition, and,
mister, until you have confirmation, you do <i class="calibre4">not</i> have cause, and you do <i class="calibre4">not</i>
give me orders!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh good—dissension in the ranks. Does that mean I can
hand this disaster-on-a-stick off to someone</i>? Jani lowered the V-40; the
other guard’s shoulders sagged. She gave him a barely perceptible nod, which he
returned. “I will safety the weapon and hand it to Colonel Doyle,” she said.
“Then we will go to a nice quiet place, and talk.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You will be under arrest!” Ridgeway sputtered, his face
purpling. “You threatened—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I just prevented a massacre by your order, Durian.” Jani
keyed the adjustment diverting the weapon’s prep charge. The stock warmed as
the heat dissipated. “The pulse packet from this thing could have blitzed half
this room. Packets can be unpredictable, you know. I’ve seen them circle their
targets and boomerang back on their source when conditions were right.” The
conditions involved magnetic interference caused by the lift-array rupture of a
troop transport, but no reason to mention minor details when things were going
so well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani’s words had the desired effect. Around her, outraged
mutters rose dangerously high as a roomful of aggravated paper pushers shifted
their attention to Ridgeway. She smiled at the nervous man, then handed the
V-40, stock first, to Ginny Doyle. “Let’s talk.” Her eyes met Doyle’s, and the
colonel’s glare turned even stonier. Jani recovered her bag and gave Angevin a
smile she hoped appeared reassuring.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani, Angevin, and Ridgeway waited in brittle silence
outside the cafeteria for Doyle to return from escorting her injured
subordinate to the infirmary; they then adjourned to Ridgeway’s office. He
barked an order that they not be disturbed to Greer, who had witnessed the
episode. The young man stood gaping at them until his boss shut the door in his
face. “Probably be selling bloody tickets in a minute,” Ridgeway muttered as he
engaged the lock.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
It was obvious he couldn’t decide whom to play to. He
pointedly ignored Jani as he walked to his desk, instead bestowing a look of
professional neutrality upon Doyle. The colonel’s narrow-eyed response was far
from neutral, and could only be considered professional if you thought of
occupations such as assassin. Ridgeway pulled in an unsteady breath as he sat
and offered Angevin a wary half smile.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She beamed in return. “I’m thinking of finally taking your
advice, Durian,” she said in a sprightly tone.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle glanced at Jani and cocked an eyebrow. Jani responded
with a <i class="calibre4">beats me</i> shrug.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh?” Ridgeway settled back in his chair.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m going to look up those dexxies who went to the Academy
with my father.” Angevin paced in front of his desk and counted off on her
fingers. “Senna and Tsai. Aryton and Nawar. The Big Four. The Hands and Feet
and Left Armpit and whatever the hell other assorted body parts they comprise.”
She planted her hands on the desk’s edge. “If anything happens to Steve, I will
sic them on you like a pack of dogs. Mom always said I had Dad’s mouth. Good a
time as any to try it out, don’t you think?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
During Angevin’s speech, Ridgeway’s expression altered from
surprised anger to stern disapproval. “You’ve backed the wrong horse, my dear.
That unfortunate young man has a long history of knocking over fences. Your
championing him could do your own career irreparable harm. He’s a common thug.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle dragged a couple of chairs over to Ridgeway’s desk.
“Let’s reserve judgment until we talk to the boy, Durian. My people should
corral him anytime now.” She sat, then motioned for Jani to do the same. “I
need proof. All I see now is oversolicitous mentoring.” She stared at Ridgeway,
who scowled and tugged at his neckpiece.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin, oblivious to Doyle’s allusion, smacked a fist
against her open palm. “He doesn’t like Steve because he’s colony.” She fell
into a chair and folded her arms across her chest.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway rolled his eyes. “It’s gone well beyond that,
Angevin. Only an hour ago, I spoke to a friend of Ms. Concannon’s. The man is
ex-Service. He said she sought him out yesterday afternoon and asked him some
rather peculiar questions concerning augmentation. He told me that the nature
of the questions, along with Ms. Concannon’s obvious distress, alarmed him. He
tried all night to get back in touch with her. He even visited her flat. When
he couldn’t find her, he contacted me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle tapped a blunt-nailed thumb against her thigh. “It is
not uncommon for young people to spend nights in apartments not their own.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway shook his head. “It was for Betha, apparently. The
poor young woman didn’t have much of a social life, according to the man. So
easy, to take advantage of someone like that. Lead her on.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What are you getting at, Durian?” Doyle asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Something unfortunate came to my attention a few days ago,”
Ridgeway said. “It appears our Betha had worked rather closely with our late Lady.
The same crap we’ve been dealing with for the past few months, Virginia. You
know the shape we’re in. It’s taken all my powers of persuasion thus far to
keep Justice from shutting down our Doc Control and assigning an overseer. This
examiner’s lien Cao’s doc chief has issued against us means we now have a visit
from a Court-appointed auditor to look forward to. Considering the position our
Minister is in already—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle ran a hand over her glistening scalp. “The
unemployment line forms to the right. And Steven Forell, like many of us, is
very fond of his job.” She fixed the sullen Angevin with a level stare that
worked on the young woman like a slap. “I understand Mr. Forell spent a portion
of the evening with you, Ms. Wyle. Could you tell us about it, please?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin shot Jani a pleading look. “What do you want to
know?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">My guess is Doyle knows it all already</i>. Jani pressed
a hand to her grumbling stomach. <i class="calibre4">She just wants to see where you especially
feel the need to lie</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle’s smile was deceptively reassuring. “Just start at the
beginning. What time last night did you first encounter Mr. Forell?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“About three. Maybe a little after.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That late?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I was with Risa—we were busy.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle gave Jani a look of mild curiosity, then turned back
to Angevin. “How did Mr. Forell appear to you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fine. Normal. For him. A little pissed.” Angevin’s eyes
goggled when she realized what she had said. “At <i class="calibre4">me</i>. Pissed at <i class="calibre4">me</i>.
We’d been fighting.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But you made up.” Doyle smiled again. “This morning at a
little after three.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin exhaled shakily. “Yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then you and he left the compound together, visited Betha
Concannon’s flat, spent the balance of the night at his apartment, and returned
here at seven-ten?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’ve been monitoring Steve’s and Angevin’s movements?”
Jani asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ms. Tyi, we’ll discuss your late-afternoon encounter with
Forell and Concannon after I finish with Ms. Wyle.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you questioning me in connection with a crime,
Colonel?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not at this time, Ms. Tyi. Merely—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fishing? If the issue is documents fraud, ma’am, you are
neither qualified nor authorized to question me. Only a Registry mediator can
do that, and since we are, last time I checked, in a peacetime, nonemergency
situation—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Nonemergency!” Ridgeway yanked at his neckpiece again.
“We’re on the verge of being shut down, Risa—I’d shudder to think what you deem
important!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No one’s life is at stake,” Jani replied. “No one has
died.” <i class="calibre4">We hope</i>. “We’re only dealing with reputations, which may be
ruined at our leisure.” Gradually she became aware of Doyle, who pounded her
chair arm like a uniformed metronome.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Who in hell,” she bit out, “are you to question my
authority?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Who in hell do I have to be? Steve bolted from the
cafeteria only moments before you showed up. You must have seen him, yet you
made no move to pursue him.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My people are searching for him now, Tyi—the sector-wide
lock-down has him bottled.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Lock-downs can be evaded surprisingly easily by someone who
knows the area. It’s amazing how many people seem to know this area. Yesterday,
one of the Exterior Minister’s goons kidnapped me in full view of Private
House. Do you even know of this?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle’s shocked expression answered that question. “What
goon?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Stop it! Stop it!” Angevin pounded her thighs with her
fists. “What has this got to do with Steve! What has this got to do with Nueva
Madrid and all that other crap!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
At the mention of Nueva Madrid, Ridgeway took on the
strangled appearance of someone who had just swallowed his tongue.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Angevin,” Jani said, “don’t open your mouth again until you’ve
spoken to a Registry mediator.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But I—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Keep your mouth shut.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin rose. “This is bullshit! Steve’s in trouble and
you’re all fighting about rules!” She dashed past Doyle and ran from the
office.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where the hell is she going!” Ridgeway shouted, as he,
Doyle, and Jani hurried into the hall.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle paced halfway down the passage. “She knows where her
boyfriend is, I’ll bet.” She spun on her heel toward Ridgeway. “You said his
scanpack needed maintenance, that he’d need to be desperate to bolt without
it.” She motioned to two guards standing nearby. “Which repair carrel is his?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The lock-down was tighter than Jani suspected. Or hoped. As
they tried to enter the third-floor parts bins, the system balked at accepting
even Doyle’s palm and key card.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The stink of nutrient broth sent Ridgeway to the front desk
for nose plugs. Jani trailed Doyle, Ridgeway, and the green-faced guards past
the line of carrels. Only one door stood open. Angevin leaned against the jamb,
a hand cupped over her mouth. “He didn’t do it,” she muttered as Doyle brushed
past her into the tiny room. “He didn’t do it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Doyle muttered a heartfelt, “Oh shit,” and turned back to
Ridgeway. “Notify ComPol. Tell them we need an ambulance. And the medical
examiner.” As Ridgeway left to find a comport, Doyle whispered some orders to
the guards, then gently maneuvered a shaken Angevin into the hall.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He didn’t do it,” Angevin repeated like a desperate prayer.
“He didn’t do it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani remained in the doorway. She could see Betha. On the
floor. Far corner. No need to approach. No need to confirm. She had seen more
than her share of corpses over the years.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Strange the way a body seemed to crumple in on itself after
death.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani heard the <i class="calibre4">clack</i> of a charge-through being
engaged. She turned to see Borgie draw alongside her, his T-40 humming its
standby song. He wiped a grimy hand over his mouth. His brown eyes had that
hollowed-out look, matched by his pale, sunken cheeks. “She dead, Captain?” he
asked, his voice shaky.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah.” Jani nodded, waiting for the next question. She knew
what it was, but she waited anyway. <i class="calibre4">Do you think she felt</i>—
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you think she felt anything, ma’am?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked at Betha. Outflung arms. Twisted neck. Her hair
dragged around to the far side of her face, making her look close-cropped. Just
like Yolan. “No, I don’t think so, Sergeant. Looked quick to me.” As if she
could tell. As if she could find her way out of a goddamn closet.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We aren’t going to leave her like that, are we, ma’am?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, Sergeant, we’re not. I’ll take care of it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ms. Tyi, who are you talking to?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani turned to see Doyle, surrounded by wary subordinates,
regarding her with a puzzled frown. “No one,” she replied, “just thinking out
loud.” When she turned back, Borgie had gone. But he’d left her a gift—the
burnt-leather stench of his T-40 scorched gloves. The acrid stink filled Jani’s
nose. Her eyes watered. “No one at all.”
