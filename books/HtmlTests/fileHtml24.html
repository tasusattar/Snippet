<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_33">Chapter 20</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
“Here is your seat, sir. Would you like a program?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha accepted the small booklet the young female handed
him. He fingered a page and frowned. Paper-plastic interweave. Sturdy, perhaps,
but no more so than mid-grade parchment. He looked over the polished gold
railing and down at the banked rows of seats. <i class="calibre4">So much red</i>. Every chair
had been covered in material like blood in color, even the less honored ones in
the rows above the level of his head, which he had to squint to see in the
half-light.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Behind him, doors opened and closed. “The bar is fully
stocked,” the female continued, “as is the cooler.” An expectant silence
followed. Tsecha turned to find her standing beside an open food repository
which had been set into the back wall of the small space. “There’s a seasonal
fruit tray,” she said, pointing to a multicolored pile, “and cold hors
d’oeuvres. There’s a touchpad by your seat that will connect you to our service
area. In addition, a member of our staff will stop by throughout the course of
the evening. If you prefer hot food, or if the bar lacks something, just ask,
please.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha stared at the fruit tray. Such large pieces. All so
mixed. Together. After so long, with all he had come to accept, still it
shocked him. And just resting there, for anyone to look at, to touch. <i class="calibre4">And
stored with meat and grain</i>. The words of his esteemed enemies in Temple
sang in his mind. <i class="calibre4">They do not know their food</i>. A killing insult to any
idomeni, even Haárin, but one which meant nothing to humanish.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Will there be anything else, Mister Hansen?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha blinked. His films, the darkest brown he could find,
squeezed his eyes, drying them as the winds that blew through Rauta Shèràa.
“No,” he said, “thank you.” He smoothed his humanish neckpiece, black as his
evening suit, and curved his mouth without baring his teeth. “I am quite fine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He did not sit until the female left him. So unseemly, to
remain standing in the suborn’s presence. The anxiety that plagued him during
these excursions coursed through him with his blood. <i class="calibre4">Not a good idea</i>,
his Hansen of the godly hair had told him the first time Tsecha tried to
impersonate humanish. The words <i class="calibre4">sore thumb</i> had also been used, although
when Tsecha had sought to divine their meaning from his handheld, the
definitions made no sense.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Despite Hansen Wyle’s misgivings, Tsecha’s first sojourn had
gone well. One of Eamon DeVries’s females had helped with makeup. John Shroud
himself had applied the eyefilms. His Jani, who was still a lieutenant then,
arrived later to brief him on things a colonial humanish should know. <i class="calibre4">You’d
never pass as Earthbound in a thousand years, nìRau</i>, she had told him, so
somber in her stiff uniform. <i class="calibre4">Don’t even try</i>. She had been more concerned
about his excursion than Hansen. Her doubt, more than anything, had driven
Tsecha forward.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He had served as a tour guide to a group of the humanish
Consulate’s high-ranking visitors. He had been commended for his expertise as
he escorted officials through the city of his life. In the process, he learned
more of humanish behavior than he ever could have from his handheld or his
discs.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I was even given tips.” Tsecha bared his teeth as he
recalled the pile of chits and the look on Hansen’s face as he counted them. <i class="calibre4">Only
you could turn a profit from acting like a jackass</i>, his godly hair had said.
Those words also made no sense. He had not acted as an animal, but most
assuredly as humanish. One of the officials had even asked him if he was
Phillipan. That had made him feel most proud.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He looked again over the railing. Humanish streamed in
through many doors, then wound down aisles and up and down steps to their
seats. Some had guides, dressed in dark blue tunics and trousers as his female
had been. Others found their own way. A few could not, however, and wandered as
though lost. Once or twice, voices rose as small groups waved their arms and
pointed to seats. Tsecha bared his teeth. <i class="calibre4">The number on the ticket is to
match the number on the chair</i>. That, he had learned on his own, only a
short time ago, and by himself. Only humanish could turn such a simplicity into
confusion.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He stroked the arms of his seat. The cloth that covered them
felt as close-clipped fur, pleasing to his touch. <i class="calibre4">My nìa Sànalàn has told
all I am at high prayer</i>. A series of pleas to each of the Vynshàrau’s eight
dominant gods, the holiest rite for a chief propitiator. Not even the head of
Temple or the secular Oligarch could disturb him at such. <i class="calibre4">Nor my nìa</i>.
For such did she believe as well. That he lied to his suborn at all did not
disturb him as much as that he did so so easily. The change had embraced him
already, perhaps, leaving none of its physical signs. <i class="calibre4">I am one with my
kìershia, my Captain. I am toxin</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha directed his attention to the front of the huge room.
A large drapery, shiny as metalcloth and dark gold in color, separated the
audience from the place where the performance would occur. A holodrama, to be
performed by images of humanish actors, both living and dead.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He studied his program, which had been printed in the
dominant humanish languages, decoding his way between blocky English script and
more logical Mandarin. <i class="calibre4">Tales of Arthur</i>. An ancient dominant. <i class="calibre4">A king</i>.
There would be battles on horseback and tragic love. Witches. Dragons. <i class="calibre4">And a
dancing goat</i>. Tsecha made a gesture that would have shocked his suborns and
made Hansen Wyle laugh. He longed for his handheld, if only to inform him what
exactly a goat was.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Loud voices and laughter drew his attention. Other
compartments like his ran along the curved sides of the immense room. The noise
emanated from the third compartment to his right. The curve of the wall was
such that he could see quite clearly the owners of the voices. Which meant, of
course, they could see him as well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Anais Ulanova expected to see no idomeni this night. The
gown she wore glowed red as molten metal, revealing her body in the way many
humanish females preferred. Five others joined her, three males and two
females. Tsecha recognized Treasury Minister Abascal and his solitary wife, as
well as Deputy Prime Minister Langley and a very young female he had once heard
some humanish refer to as flavor of the month. Only this female was most dark,
while the one he had seen at his welcome ceremony had been most light. A seemly
elevation for all involved, he felt sure. Most as idomeni. <i class="calibre4">Why then did the
humanish laugh so</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha looked at the third male, who stood behind Anais’s
chair. He wore the uniform of a Service officer. Most young, he seemed; only
the flavor appeared younger. <i class="calibre4">His hair is almost as John Shroud’s</i>. Tsecha
grew conscious of the fact the male studied him as well. He responded with the
slight nod Hansen Wyle had told him was suitable for such meetings.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The male did not nod back, but continued to stare openly
until Anais claimed his attention by turning in her seat and gripping his hand.
Only then did he smile, baring his teeth almost as widely as Vynshàrau as he
leaned toward his dominant. Quite a seemly pairing, perhaps, if one looked only
at faces.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But Tsecha studied the man as idomeni. The stiffness of his
neck. The angle of his head as he sought to turn away from the Exterior
Minister without seeming to. How his left hand, hidden behind his back,
clenched and worked. Almost as simple as idomeni, these walls, at times. <i class="calibre4">Anais’s
warrior is not a willing suborn</i>. Then what held him there, as spikes to the
floor?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
With signal flickers, the illumins died. Voices faded. Once
more, Tsecha felt the male’s gaze upon him, piercing through the half-night as
a weapons sight. At last, the blessed curtain rose. The humanish clapped their
hands, and the booming, wheezing disorder that constituted their music began.
Even as the noise buffeted him, Tsecha felt his fear leave. With such as
Anais’s unwilling warrior near, he felt more comfortable in the dark.
</p>


<p class="separator">
<img src="conduct_scene_sep4-transpbg-2fh.gif" alt="Scene Separator" title="Scene Separator" class="calibre5"/>
</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
<i class="calibre4">If my Temple knew me
to be here, I would be made Haárin, and truly.</i>
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The hologram actors, clothes aglow with too-vivid color,
voices more measured and clear of tone than any humanish speech Tsecha had ever
heard, displayed the story of the king. The Vynshàrau worked against the
aggravating comfort of his chair. If only there were some humanish he could
trust, who could explain this king to him!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Why is he dominant, this Arthur, when he has no more
sense than a young one</i>? His dominant wife had agreed to elevate a suborn
male, who had chosen her freely. Such was a most seemly occurrence, greatly to
be wished; yet the king looked upon it as betrayal, a threat to order. Then
there was a skein member, a nephew, who sang of injustice and plotted murder
even though he was true suborn and had no right to rule. And suborns who wore
clothes of clanking metal and rode off on meaningless quests, for objects,
leaving their own skein members behind, confused and grieving.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">The tragedy is the disorder</i>! An illumin shone on the
pad near Tsecha’s chair. He slapped it dark. Let his blue-clad female take her
offerings elsewhere. He thought of the food repository behind him as, onstage,
the actors sat down to a banquet. How they ate and drank and shouted as the
humanish audience laughed and cheered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He watched food pass from hand to hand, from one plate into
many mouths, and felt an ache in his soul. Two actors dressed in scraps of dull
cloth scuttled across the stage after a chunk of meat discarded by a dominant,
tearing at it as animals. Just then, the hot, spicy odor of broiling drifted
into Tsecha’s compartment from another. His stomach lurched. He forced himself
to stare at the carpet at his feet as his eyes watered and his throat
tightened.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He barely staunched a cry as behind him, a soft tapping
sounded. “Compliments of the theater, Mister Hansen,” a voice muttered through
the thin door. “If you pad me in, I can set it up for you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha lowered to his hands and knees and crawled across his
own floor as the beggars had across theirs. He pressed his face against the
door, breathing through his mouth to shut out the stench of food not his own.
“Go away,” he rasped. “I want nothing.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Compliments of the theater, Mister Hansen,” the voice
persisted, like the yammer of demons. “A signature is required, even if you
turn it down. Procedure, sir.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">A signature</i>. To breathe, the humanish needed
signatures. <i class="calibre4">But if I open the door, I can leave</i>. Escape the small
compartment. Flee into the cold, cleansing night. Tsecha stood, scrabbled with
the latch, flung the door wide and stilled as he looked into the face of
Anais’s warrior.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">NìRau ti nìRau</i>.” The moonlight head glinted as it
tilted very slightly to Tsecha’s right. An angle indicating true respect, but
with no implied intimacy of friend or enemy. “Is this performance boring you as
much as it is me?” He crossed his right arm in front of his chest, palm
outward.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha glanced at the designators on the man’s collar. Red
bars. Mainline lieutenant. Yes, this officer had greeted him in quite the
correct way, and truly. <i class="calibre4">a lète ona vèste, Nemarau</i>—his Anais’s source for
High Vynshàrau had, with no doubt, come from a place much closer than an office
within Exterior Main.
</p>


<p class="separator">
<img src="conduct_scene_sep4-transpbg-2fh.gif" alt="Scene Separator" title="Scene Separator" class="calibre5"/>
</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
“I could see you, even in the dim light.” The lieutenant
led Tsecha from an upper-level theater exit and into a glass-covered walkway
suspended above the street. “You began fidgeting during that scene in the
stables, where Lancelot fed his horse as he sang about Guinevere. After that, I
waited fifteen minutes, then came by to pay my respects.” He turned, hands
linked behind his back. Even in the dark, his hair shimmered. “Actually, nìRau,
I’m surprised you lasted as long as you did. Makes me wonder what you were
trying to prove.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Prove?” Tsecha slowed, stepping around the man as though
avoiding a hazard in the street. “I am curious only, Lieutenant”—he edged just
close enough to read the man’s name designator—“Pascal. I wish only to learn of
those with whom I have been charged to deal.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, in the dark, you appear humanish enough. And your
English is exceptional, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It is not a complicated language, Lieutenant.” How easily
he lied. But what could Pascal know of his handheld, or of his quest to read
between lines?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You consider Mandarin Chinese much more respectable, for
its structure and order.” Pascal proceeded down the walkway, beckoning Tsecha
to follow. Beneath them, skimmers darted in the night like huge waterflicks,
following the phosphor trail of the well-illumined roadway and bright
buildings. “And French, for its sound.” His pace quickened as he stepped off
the walkway and down a narrow flight of stairs. Then came a series of winding
indoor hallways.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">We are in a building now—and I am most lost</i>. Tsecha
hurried after Pascal as they passed through door-lined halls and lobbies much
as those in Interior Main, though smaller in scale. The other humanish he saw
were male. Some stood in the halls and talked; others emerged from rooms in
pairs or groups. At times, curious glances came to rest on Tsecha, but most
seemed directed at Pascal. He ignored the attention, the occasional reaching
hand or calling of his name. Instead, he walked on as though alone until he
stopped before one of the identical doors, removed a key card from his tunic
pocket, and coded his way inside.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The room contained only a bed, a frame chair, and, in a tiny
alcove, a humanish sanitary room. “No food,” Tsecha said. “I am most glad.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“People don’t come here to eat, nìRau.” Pascal unbuttoned
his tunic and massaged the grooves the collar had pressed into his neck. His
undershirt, to Tsecha’s surprise, matched the red stripe running down the sides
of his trousers.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Has your Service altered its uniform code, Jeremy? I
thought only white shirts were allowed.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The lieutenant sat down on the bed. “A small freedom. One of
the benefits of a Cabinet posting.” He looked at Tsecha with narrowed eyes.
“Why did you call me <i class="calibre4">Jeremy</i>?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha sat in the frame chair. The seat proved nicely rigid,
but he wondered the purpose for the buckled fasteners on the chair’s arms. “One
of the men outside called to you in that way. Is that not your name?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sometimes.” Pascal’s lips curved in the way Eamon’s did
when he felt he had been clever. “It’s handy to have access to a place like
this. At times, you need to talk to someone, but neither of you wants the true
nature of your discussion known. So, you come here. Much better than a cabinet
interrogation room. Rather like hiding in plain sight.” He looked over at
Tsecha. “My real name is Lucien, by the way, though I’d prefer you didn’t use
it here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But your name is on your tunic, most easy to see. How
difficult would it be for someone to learn your true identity?” It would have
taken Hansen no time. Of that, Tsecha felt most sure.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know. It’s just the principle of the thing, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I am between lines</i>. “It is disorderly.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien bared his teeth and laughed. “Actually, <i class="calibre4">disorderly</i>
is a more appropriate term than you’ll ever know, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Indeed.” Tsecha looked out the room’s tiny window, but
there was nothing of interest to see, only the filtered illumins of buildings
he did not know. “Anais will notice you are gone?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I told her I had a call. She’s learned to accept my
devotion to duty.” Lucien continued to massage his neck. “Speaking of devotion
to duty, nìRau, have you had any success with your search?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha shifted in his seat. He valued the focusing ability
of discomfort, but he would not try wearing close-fitting humanish trousers
again soon. “My search?” He touched his eyelids. They had begun to itch.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“For Jani Kilian.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Kilian? Who is—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Anais has been looking for her for months. She thought, for
a time, that she had her.” Lucien rose and walked to the window. “Maybe she
did.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha rubbed his eyes again. He shivered—it had grown very
cold as well. He clapped his hands together to warm them. “Who is this Kilian
of whom you speak, Jeremy? Are you sure of your names? You possess so many.
They must be easily confused, and truly.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien turned. For the shortest time, his face held no
emotion. Then his teeth flashed and he raised his right hand in a Haàrin
gesture of irreverence. “<i class="calibre4">Touché</i>, nìRau.” He refastened his tunic,
wincing as he clasped the collar. “Well, we never had her, and you didn’t want
her if we did. Nothing lost.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha again pressed his fingers to his eyelids. The films
had begun to prickle, but at least that made his eyes water. He would have to
find a heavier jacket for these humanish evenings, one that protected him from
the icy Chicago air. <i class="calibre4">The inset read, WINTER WOOL</i>. Would he have to learn
to read between the lines of clothing labels as well?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Between the lines.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Ah</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, I’m sorry to have wasted your time, nìRau,” Lucien
said. “But if we’re lucky, that damned play might be over by the time we get
back to the theater.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha remained seated. The chair proved quiet focusing. He
had even developed a tolerance for the trousers. “Lucien, if you found this
Kilian, what would you do with her?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Bring her here,” the man answered after some time, “just to
see the look on her face.” Under Tsecha’s steady stare, he hesitated. “I
wouldn’t hurt her.” He stepped into the sanitary area and removed a comb from
his pocket. “It’s all theory, of course, isn’t it, nìRau?” he said as he
arranged his hair. “Seeing she’s dead.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I understand this Lucien now</i>. Could Hansen even have
done so well? “How humanish talk. When they wish something not to exist, they
execute it by not speaking of it. And when they want something more than their
own life, they invent it from nothing by speaking of it at all times.” Tsecha
bared his teeth as Lucien turned to him, again expressionless. “But we have
more than nothing here, do we not? She hides in plain sight. Where is she?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She’s dead.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Where is she</i>!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien continued to comb his hair. “Safe, for now. In plain
sight.” The hands stopped. “Could you shelter her, nìRau, if necessary?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.” Tsecha again scratched the skin on his hands, then
stifled a sneeze as his face started to itch as well. “But I know one who
could.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“One who could. Does that mean you still talk to your
friend, John Shroud?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha shook his head. As an esteemed enemy, yes, but as a
friend . . . . He shivered again, this time not from the
cold. “I do not speak to Physician Shroud as a friend.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The lieutenant thrust his comb back into his pocket. “Well,
the next time you don’t talk to him, don’t forget not to ask him about that
illegal trial he never performed three years ago. The one where he studied the
effects of Ascertane on some of the chev Haárin living on Elyas.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Don’t forget . . . not . . .
never</i>. Tsecha took a deep breath. His head cleared even as the inside of
his nose tingled, forcing him to fight back another sneeze. <i class="calibre4">So the rumors
were true, John—yet how you denied</i>. “Trial? Ascertane?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“A mild truth drug, nìRau. The Haárin can’t tolerate it.
Doesn’t do a damn thing to get them to talk, and makes them violently ill
besides. Tell him—” Lucien stopped, then gasped out another breath. He seemed
surprised he could see the puff of air. He groped in his trouser pocket and
pulled out a tiny black box, touching it so the red illumins on its surface
dimmed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Is that a recording device?” Tsecha asked, most carefully.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, nìRau, an override. They’re a specialty of mine. This
one lets me take over a room’s climate control. I can cool a room down.” Lucien
coughed. “Dry it out.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha gently prodded his eyelids. “Do you so value
disorder, Lucien?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“In myself, no.” White teeth shone. “But I enjoy inspiring
it in others.” He opened the door, leaving the room before Tsecha, as was most
proper. “Some advice, Mister Hansen,” he said, as they stepped into the hall.
“As much as I admire your daring, you shouldn’t try a stunt like this again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“My disguise is not good?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re too distinctive-looking. Your posture. Your
attitude. I wouldn’t advise a repeat performance.” Lucien led Tsecha down the
hall, ignoring once more efforts made by other males to claim his attention.
“But I can find you quite good makeup. And I can coach you. Escort you around
Chicago. Show you the ropes, so to speak.” He smiled. “Our first conspiracy.
The first of many, I hope.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Tsecha studied Anais’s unwilling warrior, now his own most
willing guide. Another Hansen had found him, another teacher of humanish ways. <i class="calibre4">What
can you teach me, Lucien</i>? He nodded to the young man, who smiled in a way
Hansen had once warned him of. So bright. So wide. <i class="calibre4">Butter wouldn’t melt in
his mouth</i>. Interesting. <i class="calibre4">He tells me I do not look humanish. I, who have
passed for Phillipan. He lies to me already, and keeps me from my Captain</i>.
Oh yes, he could learn much from watching Lucien, and truly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
They left the building by a different walkway. Tsecha looked
up into the night sky, picking out the brighter stars through the city glare
and filtering glass.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How did you get here, nìRau?” Lucien asked. “Just out of
curiosity.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I drove, Lieutenant.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Again</i>!” Lucien skidded to a halt. “Where did you
park?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“In the theater charge lot.” Tsecha rummaged through his
pockets, removing a chip of brown plastic. “I have a stub.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes. Well.” Lucien took the plastic piece away from him,
then removed a small comunit from his pocket and keyed in a code. “I’ll see you
and your vehicle get back to the embassy. Separately.” After a few hurried
words, he repocketed the device. “How did you get out of the embassy in the
first place?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I told all I would be at prayer. Thus would I be left
alone. I knew when the guards would be at early-evening sacrament. I knew which
exits were not fully scanned.” Tsecha felt his inside jacket pocket, where his
own black box rested. “I knew what to do when they were.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And your clothes?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hidden in the Exterior Security outpost which shares our
property border. If such were found in my quarters, I would be made Haárin, and
truly. But if such are found in a humanish place . . . ?”
Tsecha hunched his shoulders in a most humanish shrug.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien smiled. Differently, this time. Often had Hansen
smiled at him in that way, when they spoke of changes to come. “You’re quite
different than I imagined, nìRau.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Have you ever been in a war, Lucien?” Tsecha guessed the
answer, but waited for the man to shake his head. “One learns the most alarming
things in a war. You think you forget them, but you do not. They wait in your
memory. They never leave.” <i class="calibre4">This I know, as does my hidden Captain</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien stared at him in question. But before Tsecha could
explain further, the skimmer the lieutenant had summoned glided up to the curb.
Tsecha eased into the well-cushioned backseat, which, if not as demanding as a
Vynshàrau chair, compensated by being as comfortable as a Vynshàrau bed. As the
vehicle drifted down the street, Tsecha closed his eyes. The next thing he
knew, the humanish was calling him awake, telling him they had reached the
embassy.
