<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_25">Chapter 12</h2>

<p class="NormalFirst">
Doyle handed over the House access codes with the eggshell
grace of someone who didn’t like being on the wrong end of the favor stick.
Jani accepted them with a quick nod and a minimum of small talk, excusing
herself when Doyle’s questions drifted toward matters such as “which colony,
exactly” had she come from?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She’d also deflected an invitation to brunch.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Not on my bones, you don’t</i>. Jani rushed through the
Security section, knowing her every move was being monitored. She stifled the
impulse to stick out her tongue at a wall-mounted scancam as the front-desk
guard coded her departure.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I bet Evan would love for me to find proof Ulanova had
something to do with Lyssa’s death</i>. That would give him the tool he needed
to pry her and the PM off his back for good. Not to mention win Jani some
breathing room. In the resulting scandal, who would care about her?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But that doesn’t explain what Lyssa’s death had to do
with Knevçet Shèràa</i>. Unless Evan only steered her to that conclusion to get
her to come to Chicago. <i class="calibre4">Remember the pragmatist—even if he does look great
in black</i>. She used some of her new codes to slip into the controlled
Finance section. The division cafeteria was small and, at this between-meals
hour, sparsely populated. She loaded a tray and wedged into an odd-shaped
corner table with a view of the hallway as well as the door. She was in no mood
to be caught twice. She ate quickly, then sat quietly for a few minutes. Only
when she felt certain her stomach wouldn’t reject her latest offering did she
set out on her next project.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Arrange my appointment with Ridgeway</i>. She dreaded the
prospect, but the outcry would be tremendous if she didn’t show. She coded into
the controlled-access lift, noting with relief that the floor indicator stayed
lit.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Fixed the lights, I see</i>. Jani grinned at the bright
illumination flooding her from above. She stepped into the same fourth-floor
lobby she had visited the previous day. This time, the space was empty of both
reporters and idomeni ambassadors. She headed down the widest hallway, looking
for the largest offices with the best views.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Durian Ridgeway’s, of course, proved to be the biggest of
all, a commanding corner with views of both the Main House grounds and the
lake. Jani made her appointment with a jumpy assistant, restraining an urge to
pat the young man’s hand when he made an incorrect schedule entry and wouldn’t
stop apologizing for what apparently constituted a Class X Commonwealth felony
in domain Durian.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
That task completed, Jani wandered. She checked names on
doorplates, sneaked around empty offices, and brushed off curious guards and
documents staffers by waving her access cards and sounding indignant—the
time-honored way to get into places where one had no business being.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She was debating a visit to the third-floor parts bins when
an unmarked door flew open and she found herself staring into Angevin Wyle’s
tear-stained face. She wore a rumpled Interior trouser suit. No makeup. Even
her copper curls appeared tarnished and lifeless. <i class="calibre4">Bet I know your problem</i>,
Jani thought as she reached into her duffel for more tissues. <i class="calibre4">A human
chimney named Steve</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin snuffled and straightened her shoulders. “Hullo.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
At first, Jani felt tempted to make sympathetic noises and
offer womanly advice. But her own love life had never been anything to brag
about. Besides, if the well-bred Miss Wyle had displayed the Earthbound
behavior Steve hinted at, she deserved to shed a few tears. “If Durian sees you
like this, he’ll have a fit.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin’s chin jutted. “Durian can go drown himself.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">She hasn’t gone completely over to the enemy,
Hansen—there’s still hope</i>. Jani looked up and down the hall. “Where’s a
breakroom—you could use one. I want to talk to you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t wanna talk.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, you do. Besides, you need to pull yourself together.
You look like hell.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fuck you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“See.” Jani thumped Angevin on the back just hard enough to
set her in motion. “You’re feeling better already.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
They bypassed the crowded department cafeteria. Instead,
Angevin led Jani down a dead-end hall and into a converted office furnished
with mismatched castoffs. In one corner, a bandy-legged table held an ancient
brewer, supplies of cream and sugar in cracked plastic containers, and a tiny
cooler decorated with a scrawled snack schedule.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Does Ridgeway ever come here?” Jani asked as she looked
around.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin shook her head. “Nah, he hates this place. Thinks
it’s a pit. He’s been trying to have it closed down for months, tells us the
regular cafeteria is good enough for everybody. But we block him. Durian can
lord it over civilians as much as he wants, but try telling the head of
Interior Tax Form Compliance that she can’t have her coffee and doughnut
wherever she pleases and you’re going to have a fight on your hands.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A few scattered souls already occupied the room, talking,
perusing newssheets, rustling through paperwork. Angevin exchanged greetings as
she led Jani to an unpopulated corner.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sank into a semicollapsed lounge chair. “How far back
does this room date? Since the Lyssa purge?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah.” Angevin gave her a startled look. “It got to the
point that the cafeteria . . . sometimes there just isn’t a room
big enough, you know?” She sighed. “They don’t teach you how to deal with
things like that in school.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are the ones who come here still under a cloud?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin snorted softly. “If there was even a hint of an
intimation of a possibility, Security met you at your desk and you were gone.”
She sat back in her squeaky chair. “The ones who come here—it’s just our way of
giving notice that we disagree with how things were done. It didn’t have to be
the way it was. Whatever happened to due process?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That only applies to official criminal charges.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then whatever happened to letting people explain? Most of
them thought they were doing official Interior work—that’s how she set things
up to look!” Heads turned in Angevin’s direction. She blushed and fell silent.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re Ridgeway’s right hand,” Jani said, “but you’re
accepted here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m Hansen Wyle’s daughter. That means something, from what
I understand.” Angevin looked around the room. “Maybe if I hang here long
enough, someone will tell me what that something is.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Considering how closely Ridgeway controls you, I’m
surprised he lets you come here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Before Angevin could answer, the door opened and Steve
Forell entered with a young woman in tow. As soon as she saw them, Angevin’s
eyes filled. “Excuse me,” she mumbled. Hands jammed in pockets, she exited just
as Steve and his friend worked their way over to Jani’s corner.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Good morning, Ms. Tyi,” Steve said as he claimed Angevin’s
chair. “I hope we didn’t interrupt anything important.” His look of wide-eyed
innocence disappeared when he noticed his companion still standing
shifty-footed beside him. “Crike, sit down,” he said, pushing the girl into the
empty seat next to Jani. She was as tall as Steve, with straight ash blond hair
hacked at chin length. She had overwhelmed her pointed features with heavy
makeup. A sweeping dark blue skirt and matching jacket hung on her thin frame.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m glad we caught you up,” Steve said. “I left you a
message on your House line, but this works much better.” He tossed an
exasperated look at the young woman, who sat rigid, eyes locked on his face.
“This is Betha Concannon—she’s Guernsey, too. She were also Lyssa van Reuter’s
personal documents examiner. I thought you might be interested.”
</p>

</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
“It weren’t official! She just used to have me check
things for her. Travel docs—stuff like that.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
In the friendly confines of Jani’s Private House suite,
Betha recovered both her voice and her ability to move. She paced, activated
lights, pawed bric-a-brac. However long the nervous energy had been building,
it was all dissipating now. Jani hid the sculptures and other breakables and
stayed out of her way.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve, meanwhile, prodded cushions, examined furniture, and
stared at the Channel World artwork as Jani stashed it. When the poshness
became too much to bear, he pulled out a nicstick. She could hear the crack of
the ignition tip across the room.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha slowed until she fell onto one of the sofas. “It’s not
like she had me forge IDs or anything. She just used to have me check things,
fill out forms.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What types of things, exactly?” Jani asked. “You mentioned
travel docs. Were they hers?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“For the most part. But a few of the things were old. Ten,
fifteen, twenty years.” Betha cradled a pillow in her lap. Every so often, she
gave it a squeeze.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Colonial travel?” Jani asked. “Earth vicinity? Where?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“All over the place. She went everywhere. Elyas. Amaryllis.
Kim Chun. Most of the trips were to Nueva Madrid, though. Can’t think why the
hell anyone would want to go there. All that’s there is a Service hospital.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, she was a physician,” Jani said. “One could have all
sorts of reasons for visiting a prestigious medical facility. How often did
Lyssa visit Nueva Madrid? Were the trips quarterly? Six months? Twelve?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Every five to six,” Betha replied.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Over what time span?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Almost two years.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How was she before these trips? Excited? Depressed?
Apprehensive? Did they involve business? Research?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, the papers stated she were acting as some type of
envoy. Trying to help smooth relations between Neoclona doctors and the
nonaffiliated med groups.” The rate of pillow-squeezing increased.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Did that make sense to you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha shot Jani a surprised look. “Never really thought
about it. I were just a drone in the Doc pool—thrilled to get the work.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Was His Excellency ever present when you put the packets
together? To give his wife advice, go over the itinerary?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“N-no. <i class="calibre4">No</i>. But they weren’t getting on, you know—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Did you sit in on the planning meetings? Trips like these
must have involved a great deal of strategizing.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha glanced sideways at Steve. “Yes. A couple.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Out of the corner of her eye, Jani could see Steve shift in
his seat. “Well, that’s a good place to start.” She put an enthusiastic kick in
her voice. “We’ll have agendas, lists of people Lyssa would be talking to, ship
crew lists.” She waited, her level gaze never leaving Betha’s face. “I’m
getting together with Durian Ridgeway this afternoon. If you can give me the
dates of the meetings to which you went, I can have him get me copies of the
minutes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve emitted a strangled groan. Betha kept kneading the
pillow.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No one knew about you and Lyssa,” Jani finally said. The
sound of tearing interrupted her. “Months and months go by, coworkers all
around you getting the hook,” she continued, as Betha surveyed the ripped
pillow in mute dismay. “Yet you manage to scoot through the barrage unscathed.
Pretty good maneuvering for a drone, considering anybody with any sense would
have swept you out at first pass.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So Betha weren’t the Lady’s <i class="calibre4">official</i> dexxie.” Steve,
who no longer appeared quite so smug, sat up straight. “He were shipped out to
a colonial post during the height of the troubles. No one’s heard from him
since.” He pointed to Betha. “What did you expect her to do—turn herself in?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“None of the paper you did for Lyssa went through Durian’s
office, did it?” Jani asked the sick-looking Betha. “At first, it was just a
few small favors. She was, after all, the Lady. Maybe your ticket out of the
Doc pool. Then, finally, after the favors began piling up, getting more and
more complicated, more and more risky, you asked her what the hell was going
on?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">Hey</i>,” Steve shouted, “I brought her here as a
favor—!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Be quiet.” Jani turned back to Betha, who still clutched
the ripped pillow. “That’s when she threatened you. Told you what she’d do to
you if you didn’t keep your mouth shut?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
After a long silence, Betha spoke. “If you already know so
much, why ask me? If you already know what happened, what chance do I have?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">More of one than I did, when Riky Neumann cornered me</i>.
“You filled out the travel docs for Nueva Madrid?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You didn’t register them or obtain Durian’s approval?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. She asked me not to. She said she’d handle it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve buried his head in his hands.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“In the meantime,” Jani said, “Lyssa went through her
regular dexxie for another set of travels docs, the ones her husband and her
staff knew about. <i class="calibre4">Those</i> were the envoy papers. Same times, same
location, different purpose.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes,” Betha said. “She said if I told anyone, she’d make
sure I got deregistered. At the very least.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve cleared his throat. “You think the Lady were sick?
Getting some type of medical treatment she didn’t want the Minister to know
about?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani jerked her head in Betha’s direction. “She vetted the
return-trip papers, I assume. I think you should ask her.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t think it could have been anything serious.” Betha
started picking out the pillow stuffing and worked the feathery foam between
her fingers. “I don’t have much experience in medical records—just my school
courses—but I never saw any patient copies of referral documents, or codes for
consultation summaries.” She shrugged weakly. “Besides, she never seemed
nervous or anything. Once, she even said she were taking a vacation. ‘Going
surfing, Betha’ she told me. ‘Going to learn how to surf.’”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani felt the clammy grip of nausea that had nothing to do
with food. She might not yet know who killed Lyssa or why. But she knew how.
“How many times did she mention surfing?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Two, three times.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve ignited another nicstick. “Does that mean something?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Maybe.” Jani paused. “How much room do we have to maneuver?
Any audits coming up in the foreseeable future?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve moaned as Betha worked to her feet. “The general audit
starts next week,” she said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Next week!” Jani smothered a groan herself. “Seven days
until your paper house gets blown down by the big bad wolf.” She worked her
neck, listened to the bones crackle. When general auditors fired, they seldom missed.
She’d have to move pretty quickly if she wanted to help those two morons remain
in the Registry. And out of prison. “That leaves us with lots of ground to
cover in a very short time.” She rose as quickly as her aching back would
allow. “Leave me alone to think. I’ll track you down when I need you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No reason why we should help you,” Steve huffed, hands in
pockets, slouch in full, sagging bloom.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Felony documents fraud,” Jani said, pointing to Betha, “and
accessory after the fact,” she added as she gripped his sleeve and pulled him
toward the door. “Besides, you’d rather have to do for me than anyone else
you’ve ever known.” She met Betha’s <i class="calibre4">not again</i> look head-on. “Well, if
you had said no in the first place, you wouldn’t be in this mess.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha fingered the worn edge of her jacket cuff. “How? She
were the Lady. I’m just . . .” She pulled a thread from the
frayed edge. Her shoulders slumped. “How could I say no?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Same way I did. No, Colonel Neumann, sir, I will not sign
off on your faked medical files. No, Colonel Neumann, sir, I will not fill out
the transfer justification for your faked files</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
No. No. It did get through, eventually. One way or another.
Jani escorted the somber duo to the lift and smiled at them as they boarded the
car. Steve looked away, while Betha stared at her like a trapped animal.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The stare jarred Jani. She remained in the hall as the lift
doors closed, trying to punch holes in memories that insisted on forcing their
way to the surface. Gawky, sloppy Betha. <i class="calibre4">Take away the bad makeup and trim
the hair into a Service burr, you’ve got Yolan</i>. Corporal Yolan Cray, who
would have been—Jani did a quick mental calculation—thirty-seven Common years
old now.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She returned to her suite. After clearing away pillow
remnants, she closed herself in her office, righted Lucien’s card, and stared
at it. <i class="calibre4">Were you trying to tell me something, Lieutenant</i>? Sailracing.
Before the self-propelled sailboards had been perfected, the racers had to rely
on Mother Nature. Windsurfing, they had called it then. <i class="calibre4">So Lady Lyssa
learned to surf</i>. Learned to ride what Jani and her fellow augies had
called, in grandiosity born of fear, the solar wind. Learned to smell berries
the year ’round, hear colors, see sound, feel the blood flow in your veins.
Learned that no matter what, dying was for others, but never for you.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She freed the gossip holozine from its hiding place in her
duffel. Along with the childhood pictures, wedding portraits, and images of the
great lady in decline, some ambitious soul had constructed a timetable of the
last few years of Lyssa van Reuter’s life. Jani studied the timeline. Public
battles with Evan and other minor embarrassments filled in the gaps between the
major blowups. Skimmer accidents, disappearances, extended visits to
sanitariums run by unaffiliated meds. But never a Neoclona or Service facility.
Never someplace where they could tell.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Every few months, another crash</i>. Another disconnect
with reality. It happened sometimes, with those who had been augmented when
they shouldn’t have been. <i class="calibre4">So she started taking herself to Nueva twice a
year to have her brain reset</i>. Had the flashing lights shoved in her face
and went bye-bye. Jani had hated take-down—a minute of fast-forward
hallucinations followed by a week of “what’s my name” loginess. <i class="calibre4">No more for
me</i>. Not ever.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Any augmented vet who worked for Interior had to be checked
out every six months, with at least one precautionary take-down per year. Evan
had said so himself. He was aware of the pattern—you’d think the timing of
Lyssa’s trips would have sounded a chord with him. Then again, maybe not. Lyssa
wasn’t Service—any rumor that she had been augmented would have been laughed
off the newssheets.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Oh my Lady. Why</i>? To understand what Martin went
through, why he did the things he did? Or was it to torture herself, punish
herself for allowing it to happen? Jani poked absently at her numb left hand,
ran a live finger over dead flesh and bone. <i class="calibre4">I wish I could have met you
first, Lyssa</i>. She could have told her it wouldn’t help. Nothing did.
</p>
