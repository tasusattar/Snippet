<p class="NormalFirst">
It seemed only seconds had passed when Jani felt a sharp
poke in her rib cage. Her hand shot out and closed around a wrist—a startled
yelp filled her ears. She opened her eyes to find a gape-mouthed Angevin
standing over her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sorry,” Jani said as she released her. “You surprised me.”
She sat up slowly. Her stiff back complained anyway. “How did you find me?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I work here, remember?” Angevin eyed Jani warily. “You want
to ditch a meeting, you hide in the dissertation section.” She massaged her
wrist. “Damn it, that hurt!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I said I was sorry.” Jani felt her cheeks burn. <i class="calibre4">You’re
in civilization now, remember? No one’s going to arrest you in your sleep</i>.
That was Evan’s promise, anyway. “Want some friendly advice?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t surprise people who do sneaky work in the
Commonwealth’s name. We tend to overreact.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Now you tell me.” Angevin dragged over a chair and sat
down. She had already draped her coat over a nearby planter and set an
assortment of bags on the floor near Jani’s lounge. “Oh well, I’m sorry I
sneaked up on you,” she said hurriedly. “Never happen again, that’s for sure.”
She remained quiet for a time, her hands folded in her lap. “I’ve brought that <i class="calibre4">stuff</i>
from Lucien,” she finally said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“He had it ready!” Jani struggled to her feet, trying to
decide which sack to root through first. “He gave you all these?” she asked as
she reached for the nearest bag.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No! That’s mine.” Angevin slid to the floor and wrested the
bag from Jani’s grasp. “These are mine, too,” she added, indicating the others.
Then she removed a battered yellow sack from the hidden depths of the melange
and handed it to Jani. “This one is yours.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stared from her single parcel to the impressive array
spread out before her. “You went shopping?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, after I called Lucien I had to wait for him, didn’t
I? Then when he showed up, he said there was something he needed to buy, too.
We worked fast.” Angevin held up a pullover and eyed it skeptically. “I thought
you said he was good-looking.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t think so?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No. Good-looking for men equals average. Lucien is not
average. Lucien is gorgeous.” Angevin tugged at her rumpled shirt. “You could
have warned me—I’d have changed. Not that it would have mattered. All he did
was ask about you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Really?” Jani peeked into her bag and opened the plastic
pouch containing the jig. The device’s beige case shone back. “What did he want
to know?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The usual. ‘What’s Risa doing tonight? How’s she feeling?
What did she tell you about me?’” Angevin had draped the pullover across her
chair, and was now examining the seams on a pair of trousers. “I thought I was
in prep school again. Introduction to the Lovelorn.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sorry.” Jani stuck her finger in a shallow depression in
the jig’s side. It squealed in response, and she shut the bag hastily. “I
thought it would be fun for you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, he hit on me. Asked me out to dinner. But I could tell
his heart wasn’t in it.” Angevin cast dubious glances at the bag in Jani’s lap
as she continued to fuss over her purchases. “All your <i class="calibre4">stuff</i> in good
shape? Nothing missing?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Everything’s fine,” Jani said as she gathered her duffel
and bag and rose to her feet. “Where are the workstation carrels?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll show you.” Angevin assembled her booty. “Follow me,”
she said as she jostled down the aisle.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You can tell me the way—I’ll find them.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t mind.” Angevin led the way through the Library,
fielding greetings from other patrons and offering comments on the state of her
day.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani, for her part, avoided making eye contact with anyone.
A disturbingly large number of people seemed interested in the reason for her
presence in the Library. One young man, thwarted in his attempts to engage her
in conversation, cursed her under his breath, calling her van Reuter’s hatchet.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’ve become the topic of the day,” Angevin said. “Some
folks think you’ve been brought in to do the final post-troubles cleanup.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s ridiculous,” Jani muttered. The workstation carrels,
she was relieved to see, were located in a quiet area of the Library. She
followed Angevin into one of the small rooms and immediately closed the door.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sorry about the gauntlet,” Angevin said. “Like I told you,
the place has become a rumor mill.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sat down in front of the workstation display. “I just
didn’t think I’d be caught in the grinders.” She set her bags on the desk, then
looked over at Angevin. “Thanks for your help,” she said. “I don’t want to keep
you from your meeting.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin made no move to leave. She set her parcels on the
floor, then massaged her palms where the handles had bitten. “Can I ask you a
question?” She waited for Jani’s nod. “You carry a ’pack.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re in Registry. I looked you up this afternoon.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Good job, Evan</i>. “Your point?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t act like a documents examiner. You keep popping
up all over the complex. Asking questions. You act like a verifier. You worry
people.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t mean to,” Jani said. “Look, I’m working under His
Excellency’s mandate. Anything I ask someone to do is completely legal. You
have nothing to be concerned about.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m sorry, but friends of mine who swallowed that line
before found themselves suspended. Or deregistered. Or worse.” Angevin folded
her arms and ground her heels into the thick carpet. “What are you doing here?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You took part in the documents transfer on the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>,
Angevin. I think you have a pretty good idea.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You’re supposed to be looking into Lyssa van Reuter’s
death,” Angevin said. “Outside eyes, according to Durian, on the lookout for
things that could hurt His Excellency. Is that really the whole story?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Like you said, Durian didn’t get where he is by making
mistakes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You know, I helped you. The least you could do is level
with me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What makes you think I’m not?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin gathered her bags, her cheeks flaming. “Next time
you need <i class="calibre4">stuff</i> picked up, you can get it yourself,” she said as she
hustled out of the carrel.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sat still for a time, staring at nothing. <i class="calibre4">What the
hell is going on here</i>? She should have been able to disappear within the
hugeness of Interior, but the people she encountered were stretched tight
emotionally, sensitive to every intrusion. <i class="calibre4">And the only buffer I have is
Evan</i>. Evan, who didn’t communicate with his staff. Evan the drunkard. Evan
the target. Evan, who people thought capable of murdering his wife.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">But that’s a discounted rumor</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Why had it been a rumor at all?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani pulled the yellow bag into her lap. First, she removed
the jig, then a thick documents pouch adorned with the crimson Exterior seal.
The seal had been tampered with—the color had blotched and the Ministry emboss
had puckered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Lucien must have worked in a hurry</i>. Jani cracked the
ruined seal and removed the weighty sheaf of Cabinet parchment. TOP SECRET had
been stamped in the margin of the first page. COURT OF INQUIRY adorned each
header. The word <i class="calibre4">draft</i> was nowhere to be seen.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Lucien had stolen Ulanova’s copy of the Court’s final
report.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t mess about, do you, Lieutenant?” It crossed
Jani’s mind the sort of distraction Lucien must be providing to keep Anais
Ulanova from discovering his crime; stomach churning, she hurriedly activated
her scanpack and began a confirmation check of the report. Knowing the
lieutenant, she realized that he relished the danger he’d put himself in. But
the line between worthwhile risk and recklessness was hair-thin. If she had to
walk the report through the snow herself, she’d make sure Lucien had it back in
his hands in the morning. Even if he distracted Anais to the point of mutual
exhaustion, the minister would have to look for the document eventually.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“All green,” she breathed as she scanned the final page. Not
a dummy report assembled to throw off an office mole, but the real thing. She
quickly leafed through to the appendix and studied the ID strings of the
evidence used in the compilation. <i class="calibre4">SRS-1</i> jumped out at her again and
again. Service papers, issued by First D-Doc, Rauta Shèràa Base.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I probably imprimateured some of those.” Jani removed the
jig from its bag, then gave it a once-over with her debugging stylus. <i class="calibre4">It’s
not that I don’t trust you, Lucien—I just have a healthy respect for your sense
of whimsy</i>. She stared at the doughnut-sized device’s featureless case,
trying to figure out how to attach it to the workstation. Finally, she touched
it to the rear of the display, staring in wonder as it remained in place. After
a few seconds, it emitted a barely audible squeak. Then a soft green light
glimmered from its depths.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani took a deep breath and activated the workstation.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Passwords, Lucien,” she said as she worked her way from
Interior House systems into general access Exterior. “I need passwords.” She
scrabbled once more through the bag, but found it contained only a small box
wrapped in silver paper.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Damn it!” One of Angevin’s purchases, no doubt,
accidentally dumped in the wrong sack. Jani was ready to stuff it back in the
bag when she stopped and took a better look.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">This is posh Galleria gift wrapping, huh</i>? Wrinkled
paper. Crooked seams. Curled corners where the sealant had been sloppily
applied.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani ran a thumbnail beneath the paper seaming, unwrapped
the box, and smoothed the gift wrap. Scrawled passwords filled the white
underside of the paper. Random strings of letters and numbers. Proper names.
Places. The occasional foul word.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t believe in keeping it simple either, do you?” She
set the sheet of passwords beside the display. Then, with some trepidation, she
opened the box.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
. . . <i class="calibre4">he said there was something he
needed to buy, too</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The toy soldier was small, six or seven centimeters tall.
Exquisitely crafted. Every button had been brushed with silver, each
microscopic medal glazed with colored enamels. He wore modern dress blue-greys:
steel blue crossover tunic and grey knife-creased trousers cut along the sides
with the requisite mainline red stripe. The hair visible beneath his brimmed
lid glimmered pale blond; his right arm was bent in a permanent salute.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you trying to tell me something?” Jani examined the
figure for any sign Lucien had inserted something untoward in the tiny body.
She scrabbled again for her sensor and scanned the figure as she had the jig.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Disease-free,” she said, placing her new mascot beside the
touchboard. Then she flexed her fingers like a musician warming up, keyed in
the first of the purloined passwords, and began mining history. As she cut
through the protective barriers of bomb shelters and mazes, she could almost
imagine herself in the small office in the hospital, digging through the
patient records Neumann hadn’t managed to hide. For an instant, the
burnt-leather tang of shooter gloves stung her nose. She sensed Borgie standing
behind her, reading the screens over her shoulder as he had then. She twisted
around in her seat, heart pounding, but of course no one was there.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Of course</i>. Jani checked the carrel door to make sure
Angevin had closed it. Only then did she return to work.
</p>


<p class="separator">

</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
If the curious had found Jani unresponsive before her
disappearance into the workstation carrel, they found her damned near aphasic
when she emerged, an hour and a half later.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I’m sorry. Very sorry</i>. She offered silent apology to
the librarian she brushed past, the young man who smiled and offered “Hello.”
Yes, they had their own reasons for wanting to talk to her, but she had the
experience to work around their concern. She could have calmed their groundless
fears with a few well-considered words, convinced them it was safe to let her
fade into the background where she belonged. The problem was that she didn’t
trust herself to speak. No telling what she’d say. That always happened when she
was very, very angry.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">You’re a lying bastard, Evan van Reuter. You don’t give a
damn how Lyssa died—you dragged me here to help save your father’s reputation</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She rode the lift down to the third floor, keyed through the
triple sets of doors, then let her nose guide her to the scanpack parts bins.
The residents of the floor had no doubt grown used to the characteristic odor
of spent nutrient broth, but the undercurrent of rotted fish managed to have
its nasty way with Jani’s temper-churned gut. She leaned against the doorway
leading to the bins, one hand over her mouth, as nauseated as any first-year
intern. It would only get worse once she went inside; she knew from experience
the only odor-killing ionizers on the floor would be positioned at the exit. A
dexxie was allowed to clean up for the civilians, but when in the land of your
ancestors, you sucked it in and proved yourself worthy.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Cursing softly, Jani pushed through the door. The idomeni,
with their food issues and general delicacy, handled it so much more
intelligently. Ionizers everywhere—the air in the Academy parts bins had
smelled boiled.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Place looked better, too</i>. The term <i class="calibre4">bin</i> proved
an apt description for this area, which resembled an overfilled tool kit. No
windows. Low ceilings. Narrow aisles lined with open work shelving. Repair
carrels ran along one side of the enormous room; on the other side, the
check-in desk and order-entry booths competed for space.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tried to duck into one of the booths. She accidentally
caught the eye of one of the clerks, however, and soon found herself the focus
of several pairs of helping hands. Good news traveled fast.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you sure this is the part you want, ma’am?” one of the
clerks asked as he read her scribbled order.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.” Jani tightened her grip on her duffel, shaking off
yet another eager soul’s offer to stash it behind the check-in desk. “Is there
a problem?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Mr. Ridgeway’s orders, ma’am. We need to inform him when
someone checks out an old-time chip.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, really?” Jani circled to the clerk’s side of the desk
and waited for him to key Ridgeway’s code into his comport. Chimes sounded—the
man’s face filled the display. “Durian,” she said, “I’m checking out a revised
GB-Delta twenty-year chip. I understand that’s a problem.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway stared at her pointedly, the seconds ticking away.
“Good evening, Ms. Tyi,” he said at last, smiling stiffly. Then he took a look
at his timepiece. “Shouldn’t you be getting ready for dinner? His Excellency
hates to be kept waiting.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The words <i class="calibre4">His Excellency</i> elicited shocked whispers
from the clerks. Jani gritted her teeth. “If we can settle this quickly, I’ll
be spot on time.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes.” Ridgeway glanced off to one side and shrugged quickly
at someone. “I’m in the middle of something myself.” His smile disappeared.
“Must you do this now?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ginny Doyle chose that moment to move in beside Ridgeway and
stick her head in the display range. “Hello, Ms. Tyi.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Colonel.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Digging into the archives, are we?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Trying to, if Grandma here will give me the sign-off.” Jani
looked into Ridgeway’s narrowed eyes. “You aren’t going to force me to resort
to shoplifting, are you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
One of the clerks gasped. Another snickered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
On the display, Doyle’s grin twitched. “You know,” she said,
resting a hand on Ridgeway’s shoulder, “I wouldn’t put it past her.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We’d nab her at the exit.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Perhaps, but we are due for a systems drill this week.
Let’s give her a shot.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We don’t have time for that crap now, Virginia.” Ridgeway
looked down at his desk, his fingers drumming on the shiny wood. “Simon.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The clerk who’d been waiting on Jani stepped into display
range. “Sir?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Give her the goddamned thing.” Durian’s image shrank to a
pinpoint of light.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Foot-shuffling silence reigned for a time. Then Jani brought
her fist down on the desk. “Well, you heard Grandma,” she said to the startled
faces surrounding her. “Give me the goddamned thing!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The transaction was sorted out in record time. Smiles turned
from polite to genuine. <i class="calibre4">Durian, Durian, how thee are loved</i>, Jani thought
as one of the clerks appointed herself her guide to the repair carrels. <i class="calibre4">I
should have tried this in the Library</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The young woman led her down the hall. “Is the smell getting
to you?” she asked. “You looked a little green back there.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s been a while since I’ve visited a bin this size,” Jani
conceded.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“These help,” the clerk said, handing her a small
plastic-wrapped package. “We keep them for the civvies, but the smell gets to
everyone once in a while.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani examined the small packet. Nose plugs, menthol-infused.
“Thanks,” she said as she inserted them.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The clerk stopped in front of one of the carrels and handed
Jani the key card. “It’s the only one open. Nobody else wants it.” She jerked a
thumb toward the door next to Jani’s. “Your neighbor smokes up a storm. It
seeps into the shared vent. People swear it screws up their ’packs, but there’s
no proof—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Smokes?” Jani stopped in front of her neighbor’s door. “Is
this Steve Forell’s carrel?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh God, you know him?” The clerk shook her head. “Just yell
if you need help. Make sure you open the door, first—these rooms are
soundproofed.” She flashed a smile. “If Grandma calls, we’ll let you know,” she
said as she left.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani waited until the clerk was out of sight before she
knocked on Steve’s door. “Open up. It’s Risa.” She waited. Knocked louder.
“Steve. Come on.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The door slid open. Steve blocked the entry. “What the hell
do you want?” Behind him, Betha sat at a small table, a nicstick dangling from
her lips. They both looked exhausted.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You two been busy?” Jani stepped past Steve into the
carrel. Her nostrils tingled as the clove stink of the nicsticks worked past
the menthol. “Smells like you’ve been busy. I’m not surprised. They’ll yank
both your ’packs as soon as those fake documents surface unless you can hand
them something bigger.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah, well.” Steve flipped his spent nicstick into the
trashzap. “We’ve only got your word for that, don’t we?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s why you’re both huddled in here smoking your brains
out, because you only have my word.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She’s right, Steve,” Betha said. “I looked it up.” Her
voice lowered. “The shortest sentence I could find were ten years in Lowell
Correctional. That were for only one violation. I jazzed the Lady’s docs—”
Shaking fingers ticked off the total. She sagged into her chair when she ran
out of digits.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve slumped against the carrel wall and slid to the floor.
“Yeah, well if it goes to hell, we can just blow off, can’t we? Hide out in the
colonies, with our own. Doing for our own.” He nodded firmly. “Pushing paper on
the home world—how bad could that be?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How bad do you want it to be?” Jani pulled the other chair
up to the table and set her bags down on the floor. “From that point on, all
your work would be non-Registry. You could never use your ’pack again. You
could never sign your real name to anything. And you wouldn’t be doing for your
own. You won’t even be able to <i class="calibre4">see</i> your own, because any contact with
them would be traced.” She sat down carefully. Her stomach ached. Her back
hurt. Her anger had ebbed. She felt old.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
It had been fourteen years since she’d last tried to contact
her parents. No one had been home, so she’d been transferred to a staffer from
CitéMessage. That had struck Jani as odd, since her parents had always
subscribed to the standard account with autoservice. She disconnected in the
middle of the staffer’s insistent request for her name.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The Service cruiser bearing the Admiral-General’s seal had
docked at Chenonceaux Station eight days later. Jani, who had decided to wait
it out at the station before trying another call, had huddled behind a vending
machine and watched the uniforms stream into the shuttle bound for her hometown
of Ville Acadie. “You will,” she paused to allow the tightening in her chest to
ease, “never be able to go home.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A year passed before Jani worked up the nerve to touch down
at Chenonceaux and try again. She had tapped out the code with a sweaty hand,
disconnecting as soon as she heard her father’s voice sing out, “<i class="calibre4">C’est
Declan</i>!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If you’re smart,” she continued, “you’ll stay away from
paper altogether. But that’s hard to do when it’s all you know. If you’re
lucky, you’ll find work in some high-turnover post, like shipping tech. You’ll
fill out manifests, track transports. Monitor warehouse inventory.” The words
caught in Jani’s throat. She <i class="calibre4">hated</i> warehouse inventory. “If you’re not
lucky, which is most of the time, you’ll be at the mercy of every cheap crook
who susses out the fact you’re in trouble. So you’ll do what they want, when
they want, for whatever they choose to pay you, if anything. Because you’ll
both know one anonymous call to any Cabinet annex is all that stands between
you and a prison cell. Have I made myself clear?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha stared at her, round-eyed and blanched. Steve freed
another nicstick from his pocket, wrinkled his nose, and shoved it into his
mouth without igniting it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So.” Jani paused to pat her eyelids. Her films had absorbed
the clove smoke and her eyes felt grainy. She pressed lightly, until the tears
came. “I’d like to ask you some questions, if you’re agreeable.” She waited.
“Betha?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The young woman sighed. “What?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Can you still access the paper Lyssa had you work on? Not
the Nueva trips—the other stuff. You mentioned older documents.” She knew all
she needed concerning the details of Lyssa’s visits to Nueva. They were indeed
scheduled take-downs. <i class="calibre4">Surmise confirmed—aren’t we the genius</i>? Ulanova
had had her niece followed on her excursions. According to the Court report,
Lucien had been quite the busy bee for eighteen months prior to Lyssa’s death.
So now she had the means and the opportunity nailed. <i class="calibre4">But I still need the
damned motive</i>. And motive meant paper. Jani looked at Steve. “How about
you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t have them anymore, and they’re probably beyond his
security clearance,” Betha said softly. “I don’t think he can help you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You don’t know what my clearance is!” Steve shot back.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha fingered a skirt pleat. “It would have to be at least
Orange, possibly even Blue. Only Ridgeway’s immediate staff rates Blue.” She
never looked at Steve. “Sepulveda. Zalestek. Wyle. They all rate Blue.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I take meetings with the idomeni ambassador!” Steve
shouted. “Anything I need to find, I’ll find. If I care to,” he added hastily.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked at Betha, who regarded her in turn, her
expression blank except for a faint quivering around the eyes. It could have
been a guarded attempt at a wink. Or just a tic.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m also looking for Consulate papers from our Rauta Shèràa
days,” Jani continued, “dating from just before the war to expulsion.” The
section of the report dealing with Acton had covered a respectable span of
time, but Jani had still found significant gaps. “Duty logs would be good.
Communication logs. Anything indicating who talked to whom and when.” She
pulled her scanpack from her duffel and set it on the table along with the
recently purchased chip. “Think we can meet tomorrow?”
</p>

“We’re not demanding, are we?” Steve worked to his feet. “We
can meet here at fourteen-thirty. I’ll be upgrading.” He stretched. “So why
can’t you just pull this paper yourself?” he asked. “Why step up the flame
under our arses?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fewer questions this way,” Jani replied as she rose and
walked to the carrel’s environmental control panel. “You both have reasons to
go where you’ll be going. I make people nervous, apparently, and I don’t have
time to muck about laying groundwork.” She touched the lightpad; everything in
the room took on a bluish glow as the antiseptic lighting kicked in.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What are you doing?” Steve asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani increased the ventilation setting—the carrel grew
noticeably cooler. “Surgery.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You can’t do that in here till the air flushes out!” Steve
stuffed his hands in his pockets and pouted. “People bitch about the smoke.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Hell of a lot cleaner than some places I’ve worked.” Jani
returned to the table, pulled her tool kit out of her duffel, and set out
instruments. Then she cracked her container of nerve solder and poured a few
drops of the thick brown liquid into a heat cup. “Scanpacks are hardier than
you think.” <i class="calibre4">Trust me</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha stationed herself at Jani’s shoulder. Steve sat down
at the table, fascinated in spite of the circumstances. “What are you loading?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Something that can read what you’re going to find for me.”
Jani pressed her hands flat against the sides of her scanpack and squeezed. The
cover ID’d her prints and sprang open. “A new chip’s been added to those docs
over the years. I needed new hardware.” Nestled in its case, the fist-sized
mass of brain tissue shuddered beneath its protective pink dura mater.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What kind of chip?” Betha asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Family mark. The kind used in private papers.” Jani felt
beneath the scanpack for the master touchswitch. She set the switch to CHILL,
then shut down the battery that pumped nutrient through the brain like a
miniature heart. The healthy pink color of the dura mater remained, but the
brain’s trembling slowed to an occasional shudder.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Whose?” Steve asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Won’t know until I can read the paper.” <i class="calibre4">But I can make a
damned good guess, Evan</i>. “What’s the call on that chip?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve held up the chip’s antistatic pouch and squinted.
“Five-eighths, nine to two, bleeds to death, flash activate.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani clamped the oxy feed lines to the fifth octant region
of the brain, then closed the nutrient web. The shuddering ceased. Using
microforceps, she peeled back the dura mater and anchored it to one side with a
butterfly clamp, revealing a raised freckled line of chips and nerve bundles.
She activated her laser knife, cut away the old two-nerve chip, and drew a
thread of nerve solder from the ninth nerve lead to the second, forming an
eight-nerve circuit that would drive the newer, more powerful chip.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Family chip, eh? You be diggin’ where you shouldn’t, Ris?”
Steve asked, his stare fixed on the table.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Wouldn’t think of it,” Jani replied. The fried-meat smell
of nerve solder worked past the nose plugs. Tiny puffs of smoke streamed upward
as she picked single pinholes in the tissue. Using her forceps, Jani set the
chip in place. The hair-thin anchors fit perfectly into the pattern of holes
she had cut. She attached the ends of the solder thread to the chip, baking
them into place with touches of the knife.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not bad,” Betha said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t know why in hell they make an edition chip a ‘bleeds
to death.’ Every time a new version comes out, you risk killing your ’pack on
fire-up.” Jani reactivated the battery, then touched the knife to the chip,
breaking the seal. The chip activated with an emerald flash, then faded to the
pink-tinged grey of the surrounding tissue. Slowly, Jani reopened the oxy
lines, then set the master touchswitch back to NORMAL. The octant revived with
a rippling shiver.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha exhaled slowly and massaged the back of her neck. “You
think there’s something in this House got to do with the Lady’s death?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know there is,” Jani replied.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Not an accident?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You think she were augmented.” Betha smiled at Jani’s look
of surprise. “I remember your reaction when I told you about her ‘surfin’.’
Asked an ex-Service friend what it meant. He told me. You think all her trips
to Nueva Madrid had something to do with the augmentation, that she died
because something happened to it.” She grew serious. “Because somebody did something
to it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s possible,” Jani finally said.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Betha walked to the door. “You mean yes. Why don’t you say
what you mean?” She turned to Steve. “See you later.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Where you going?” he asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Work. I’ll be in one of the spare offices if you need to
talk.” Betha smiled weakly. “’Bye.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“She’s smarter than she looks,” Jani said as the door
closed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve drew close. “Weirdo ’pack you’ve got there,” he said.
“Dull-lookin’, like a lump of mud. Tsecha’s got somethin’ looks just like it.
His thing’s like a dictionary. Got a couple human languages in it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Coincidence,” Jani said as she swept her gear back into her
duffel.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t tell me that! I seen it! I’ve sat in meetings with
him. Watched him tap at the damned thing.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stuffed the yellow sack containing the Court of Inquiry
report into her duffel. “Have you talked to Angevin today?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve’s eyes widened. He stood up, rocked uncertainly from
one foot to the other. “Nah,” he finally muttered. “Don’t have time for her
crap. It’s all over. It’s done.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani rose, then closed in on Steve until she stood toe to
toe with him. “You don’t want her linked with you in case you get arrested.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Steve tensed. “Won’t get arrested. Be gone long before
then.” He chewed his unactivated ’stick. “That story. That were just a story,
weren’t it? ’Bout what it’s like. I mean, you’re just a posh little Cabinet
cracker—what do you know about rough?” He offered her a hide ’n’ seek smile—now
you see it, now you don’t. “Were just a story, weren’t it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh yes.” Jani focused on the floor. “You found me out.
Blatant exaggeration, just to scare you.” She walked to the door. “Tomorrow,”
she said. She glanced at her timepiece as she headed for the lift. She’d be
late for dinner with Evan. After he heard what she had to say, he’d wish she’d
stood him up.
