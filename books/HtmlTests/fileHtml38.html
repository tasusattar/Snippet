<p class="Epigram">
Patient S-1 remained hospitalized and under close observation
for a period of four days. Because of extenuating circumstances and the fact
the patient displayed her usual remarkable recuperative abilities, she was then
released with the understanding that follow-up visits would take place
regularly at a facility to be determined.
</p>
<p class="Epigram">
It is believed the patient can be expected to recover fully
and to resume her normal range of activities, such as they are. However, it
cannot be stated too strongly that the long-range effects of her condition are
not known at this time.
