<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_15">Chapter 3</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
Amsun Primary’s VIP wing exuded the chilly luxury of a
Family mausoleum. Jani hitched her duffel, eyed the sculptures lining the
station’s carpeted gangway, and kept pace a few meters behind Evan, who was
busy dictating orders to a quartet of Amsun annex staffers. Each underling took
their position at his shoulder, then backed off and let another take their
place, just like lead changes during skimbike races. It had been that way since
they’d left Whalen two days ago. Every time Jani tried to question Evan about
Lyssa, an advisor would turn up to drag him off.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Maybe I need a uniform and a title to get his attention</i>.
A possibility, but not one she wanted to consider. Even in her current
circumstances, she wouldn’t have traded places with Evan or any member of his escort.
Voices snapped. No one smiled.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">We’re in Exterior country, my friends</i>. Unlike every
other Ministry, which located its main headquarters in Chicago and scattered
its annexes throughout the colonies, Exterior had moved its Main House to the
Outer Circle planet of Amsun and maintained only a token presence on Earth.
That hadn’t seemed wise when the late David Scriabin, Lyssa van Reuter’s
father, had set the transfer wheels in motion fifteen years before.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Smacks of genius now</i>. Exterior burgundy formed the
basis for every aspect of interior decoration in Amsun Primary, a constant
reminder to all parties wearing Treasury gold, Commerce green, Interior black,
and every other Cabinet hue in exactly whose sandbox they played.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani passed the portrait of a severe, dark-haired woman
wearing a high-necked tunic in the ubiquitous <i class="calibre4">colour du monde</i>. Everyone
thought Exterior Minister Anais Ulanova should have stood for Prime during the
last election. When she didn’t, the Earthbound news services professed shock.
The colonial reaction, in contrast, had been blasé. <i class="calibre4">Why fight to be shepherd
when you already own the sheep</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
As she came upon yet another holosilk study in red and
orange, Jani rolled her eyes. It was partly artistic opinion, partly
aggravation. Red was the color of blood and warning lights to her augie, the
chromatic equivalent of a scream in the night. Unfortunately, the action caused
an eyefilm to shift. She tried to blink it back into place, and it hung up on
her eyelid. Tears brimmed, then spilled as the film edge curled and split. She
cupped a hand over the damage and searched in vain for a sign indicating a
restroom.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ms. Tyi?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Tyi? Tyi</i>? That was her name now. Risa Tyi. Josephan.
Bad choice. She couldn’t speak Josephani.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ms. Tyi!” Evan had pulled up short and stared back at her.
“Is everything all right?” The look in Jani’s visible eye must have set off
alarms. “Folks, I’ll get back with you.” He left his puzzled entourage behind
and hurried to her side. “I knew you shouldn’t have flown so soon after the surgery.”
He gripped Jani by the elbow and pulled her toward the elevator bank. “I hope
the incision glue held.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
One of the underlings called out, “Your Excellency, if a
physician is required—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, no,” Evan said as he pushed Jani ahead of him into the
first open car. “We’ll meet you at the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> gate in a few minutes.”
The door hissed shut. “What happened!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sagged against the wall. “Film broke.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Can you fix it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yeah.” She shivered as the odor of berries filled the
elevator. Her mouth watered. What the overdose of red started, the stress of
the moment intensified. She breathed through her mouth in an effort to block
out the smell of fruit.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Are you all right? I know red used to get to you
sometimes.” Evan leaned close and blanched. “Oh shit.” As the door opened, he
held her back and looked up and down the hall. “Still red—cover up.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani pressed her hands over her eyes as she was herded,
dragged, and prodded. Another door opened, then whispered closed. “Evan? What
color are the walls now?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“They’re a very calming shade of blue.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani lowered her hands. The walls were indeed quite
relaxing, but some of the fixtures appeared unusual. “Evan, we’re in a men’s
toilet.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It was the closest door to the elevator, ok? People were
coming.” He activated the lock. “There. That lights up the ‘being cleaned—come
back in ten minutes’ sign.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If the hall monitoring picked us up—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“This is the <i class="calibre4">private</i> section. Anais does any scanning
here, I’ll have her ass.” Evan’s voice grew hushed. “That look you had in the
eye I could see scared the hell out of me—like you were staring up from the
bottom of a pit. Was that some kind of seizure?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani walked to the mirror above the row of sinks. “No.” A
few fissures had formed along the film’s black-and-white surface. “A
combination of the stress and the environment. The nervousness of the moment.
The augmentation kicked in.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Augmentation.” Evan gave each syllable a twist of disgust.
“You were sideline Service, not mainline. How could you let them do that to
you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I was still Service, Ev. When they tell you to peel and
bend over, you drop your drawers and think of the Commonwealth.” Jani dug into
her duffel. “Guess they thought we all needed it, with the way the
Laumrau-Vynshà situation was heating up.” She shrugged. “I have mixed feelings
about it. It helps me think more clearly in emergencies—almost like a permanent
tranquilizer implant. If I get hurt while it’s active, it kicks on adrenal and
thyroid boosters, and helps the wounds heal faster.” She checked her clear face
in the mirror. The peeling skin and rash caused by her brief exposure to the
Naxin had healed in two days, instead of two weeks. “Dulls pain.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Helped you survive the crash,” Evan added with an
encouraging smile.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s why I have mixed feelings.” Jani freed the bottles
of film former from the depths of her bag, then blended the memory film with
its activator. “Sometimes I think justice would have been better served if I’d
died with everyone else. Or if I’d died, and they’d lived.” She looked up to
find Evan’s reflection staring at her in shocked surprise. “Don’t worry. I
won’t go suicidal on you. Just a little objective over-analysis on my part.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Really?” He studied her skeptically. “I know some people
back home you could talk to about it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“PTs?” Jani peeled the ruptured film from her eye. The
tear-swollen black-and-white fragments smacked wetly into the sink. “Ev, if the
psychotherapeuticians ever got me, they’d never let go.” She activated the
faucet, cupped tepid water in her hand, rinsed away the last specks of old
film, and washed them down the drain. She didn’t notice Evan’s approach until
he stood beside her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jesus!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani stared into the mirror at her eye. The iris was still
the dark jade of her childhood. But the sclera, instead of white, shone a
lighter, glassy green that took on a bluish cast in the harsh bathroom
lighting. <i class="calibre4">Corroded copper coins—built-in pennies on my eyes</i>. At least
the pupil hadn’t changed in shape or size. And her sight had never seemed any
better or worse than other people’s.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan drew closer. “How the hell did that happen?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Contaminated starter tissue, the doctors said. No time to
grow them over.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The doctors?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“<i class="calibre4">The</i> doctors. John Shroud, Valentin Parini, and Eamon
DeVries.” They had worked out of the Service hospital in Rauta Shèràa. They had
rebuilt her after the crash, gave her strange eyes and numb limbs, and remained
together after the war to form Neoclona. Now, they controlled all the hospitals
in the Commonwealth that were worth a damn. Jani tilted her head back and
counted out the drops of film. <i class="calibre4">One . . . four, five</i>. She
held her lids open for ten seconds, then looked in the mirror. Her purple-black
eye gazed back with teenage clarity.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan cleared his throat. “Don’t you think you should do the
other one?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I just did it three days ago. Barring incident, the stuff
lasts seven to ten.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I think you should make sure.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani watched Evan in the mirror until he turned away. After
some hesitation, she peeled, poured, mixed, and counted. “Are you sure you want
to go through with this?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That sounds hopeful.” He turned back to her. “Does that
mean you’ve decided to come at least as far as Padishah?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Amsun’s too close to Whalen. I’d feel better a little
farther out.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“How will I know when you feel you’ve gone far enough?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You won’t.” Jani dabbed away a drop of film former that had
spilled down her cheek. “I’ll just be gone.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That sounds familiar.” Evan hoisted himself on the counter
next to her sink. “Sorry. Completely inappropriate.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, it was.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What’s past is past. I apologize.” He fingered the soap
dispenser. “So, how’ve you been?” He shrugged off Jani’s incredulous look.
“I’ve been weighed down with work the past two days. This is the first chance
we’ve had to talk since I rescued you from that hellhole.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m fine, Evan.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Really?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Really.” Jani’s back twinged, and she leaned against a
urinal for support. “You?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’m sorry. About your wife.” The words came haltingly.
She’d never had a talent for saying the right thing; anything she thought of
now seemed inappropriate. Death didn’t just alter. It razed. Annihilated. “Your
children, too. That was tragic.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes. Thank you. Not a day goes by that I don’t think of
them.” Evan looked at her and sighed. “You’ve wanted to ask me something
delicate for days. I can tell. Go ahead.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
There were no right words for this, either. “We heard gossip
out here in the beyond. That you and Lyssa had problems.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, we did. For the most part, however, our marriage
functioned.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sounds mechanical.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Most Family marriages are.” Evan’s eyes glinted. Sapphires
in snow. “I don’t recall you as the type to be drawn in by rumor.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Rumors blossom and seed all the time. They don’t all result
in the convention of a Court of Inquiry.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I told you, Cao and Ulanova want me out.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You must have really ticked them off.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t quite have your talent for alienating the
opposition, but I’m working on it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“There’s something you didn’t tell me. Something you left
out.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“And what could that be?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani leaned more heavily against the urinal. She could feel
the cold porcelain through her thin coverall. As cold as her right hand. As
cold as the chill that gripped her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Is something wrong, Jan?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“This concerns Knevçet Shèràa, doesn’t it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t know. But I bet you could find out.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You bastard. You set me up.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, I gave you A and B and let you reach the logical C. The
setup was all yours.” Evan glanced at his timepiece. “We better get going.” He
pushed himself off the counter, then turned to wash his hands. “I’m sorry, Jan,
but if I’d mentioned Knevçet Shèràa back on Whalen, you’d have bolted. I
couldn’t let you do that.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What am I walking into?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Nothing that endangers you. I’m the one in trouble. You’re
assumed dead, remember?” Evan gripped the rim of the sink. “Jani, your own
family wouldn’t know you. That’s how different you look. Hell, I didn’t know
you.” He reached blindly for a dispo towel. “And I knew you better than
anyone.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Better not call me ‘Jani’ anymore. Stick to Risa.” Jani
tossed her bottles into her bag and gave her eyes one last check in the mirror.
“I don’t speak Josephani, you know.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s like High Dutch.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Oh, that narrows it down. Thanks.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan unlatched the door. “We’re going to walk past a lot of
red between here and the shuttle. Will you make it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes. I’ll just get a bit wound-up. I’ll be fine.” Jani
waited for him to raise the all clear, then followed him into the hall. “Well,
that brought back memories.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan paused in mid-step, eyes widening as he remembered.
“That play. At the Consulate Hall. <i class="calibre4">Becket</i>. Intermission. The ladies’ was
crowded, and you barged in and—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Told you to shut up and guard the door. That’s how we met.”
She patted his arm. “You still guard doors pretty well.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
They both laughed, a little too loudly and a little too
long. Evan offered her his arm as they walked to the elevator bank, then bowed
like a gallant as the door opened, gesturing for her to enter first. The other
occupants smiled at them, as though the little show had brightened their day.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">You set me up, Evan</i>. Jani stepped to the rear of the
half-filled elevator and tried not to flinch as he crowded beside her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Knevçet Shèràa. <i class="calibre4">Not a day goes by that I don’t think</i>—She
leaned against the rear of the car, closed her filmed eyes, and clenched her
numb left hand.
</p>

</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
“I guess you could consider this a working vacation,” Evan
said. He nodded curtly to the steward who bustled past him, towing Jani’s
luggage in a hand-skimmer.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Correction—Risa’s luggage</i>. Jani shook her head in
disbelief as the steward disappeared into her bedroom to stash the seven brown
trueleather bags in her closet.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll unpack while you’re at dinner, ma’am,” he said as he
took his leave, all silver-blond hair and flashing smile. Jani returned the
smile to the best of her ability, then turned back to Evan to find him glaring
at her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But don’t get carried away with the vacation part.” He
walked across the large sitting room and flopped into a lounge chair. “Of
course, I don’t think I have enough work to keep you occupied for five weeks,
and what you do in your off time is your own . . . affair.” He
smoothed the front of his black uniform tunic and fixed his sights on the wall
opposite.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll try to keep the orgies to a minimum, sir,” Jani
replied quietly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That’s not what I meant.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know exactly what Your Excellency meant. I think I should
take this opportunity to remind Your Excellency that, considering certain
situations in which I have found myself in the past, if I had been the type to
think with my pussy, I’d have been dead years ago.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ja—” Evan stopped himself. He rose slowly. “Risa. How
vividly put. My apologies. I should know better.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I think with my head,” Jani continued. “If <i class="calibre4">it</i> sees
the way clear, that is of course a different story.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan gaped. He seemed to have trouble deciding what to do
with his hands, finally shoving them into his pants pockets. The move caused
his tunic to bunch unministerially over his hips. “Dinner,” he finally said.
“My private dining room. One hour after breakaway. We will have company.” He
eyed Jani’s coverall, an overlarge, chalk brown item she’d liberated from the
Whalen transport’s lost lambs bin. “We should dress.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, sir.” Jani returned Evan’s cool smile and followed him
to the door. “Label the forks, so I know which one to use when,” she added as
he stepped into the hall. The door closed before he could reply, but not before
he had shown he hadn’t lost his capacity to redden alarmingly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani knocked against the door with her forehead. <i class="calibre4">Too late
to bolt now</i>. The <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> was in prebreakaway lockdown—she’d have to
trip a hazard alarm. <i class="calibre4">I’ve done that before</i>. But not on a Cabinet-class
ship. They had Service crews aboard to put out their fires. She’d be up to her
ass in steel blue before the klaxons stopped screaming.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I’m jumping ship at Padishah</i>. She made a circuit of
her cabin sitting room, a posh retreat in pale yellow and cream, scanning the
shelves and cabinets for anything she could hock. She was examining the
contents of an étagère with a pawnbroker’s eye when she heard the door open.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ma’am.” Her steward stood in the entry holding a
bottle-filled tray. “Do you require any assistance before dinner?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani straightened. “No. Thank you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I thought you might like something to drink.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fine.” She nodded, larcenous hands locked behind her back.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“A jeune marie?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Fine.” <i class="calibre4">What the hell’s a “young mary</i>”?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The young man filled a small glass to the brim with a
garnet-colored liquid and handed it to Jani. She raised the drink to her lips,
hoping to get rid of him by downing it quickly, when the odor of berries filled
her nose.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Do you like it, ma’am?” His voice held stewardly anxiety.
“It’s new. From Serra.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“A ‘jeune marie’ is a kind of berry, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Yes, ma’am. Is everything—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Everything’s fine. Please go now. I need to get ready.” She
fought down a yell as he took his time gathering up his tray and waited for the
door to close before sinking into the nearest chair. Her stomach burned. Her
hand trembled, causing a stream of red beadlets to slosh over the glass’s rim
onto the carpet. She hurried to the bathroom, poured the reeking liqueur into
the sink, and flushed it down until she could smell only water.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Evan’s on his own—I’m jumping ship at Padishah</i>. He
didn’t need her to get him through his crisis—he was far from vanquished
politically. Or personally, for that matter. He had certainly dealt with his
own deaths better than she had with hers.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Coping? You’re kidding.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Closure? No, her wounds had gaped for eighteen years.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">You’d have to execute one hell of an inside-out to set
Knevçet Shèràa straight, Kilian</i>. She wasn’t that limber anymore.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani sat on the edge of the bathtub and unclasped her boots.
<i class="calibre4">But Evan thinks I deserve a second chance</i>. Of course, since he felt his
career was in jeopardy, he’d say anything to get her to help. Just as he’d
withhold anything he thought might scare her away. <i class="calibre4">He thinks in terms of
distance to goal and whether goal had been achieved or lost</i>. Always the
pragmatist. Even as a young Consulate deputy, his first time away from home,
with every opportunity to go off track, he always kept his eye on the ball.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
So? Maybe Evan didn’t mean what he’d said about second
chances. It didn’t follow that it wasn’t true. All her records were in secured
storage on Earth. Maybe there was something she could learn, something she
could discover that would make it not hurt as much. Something she could use to
help Evan, and, just possibly, herself.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I don’t think like that anymore. Every time I try to
help, I fuck up. I’m jumping ship at Padishah</i>. She started undoing the
fasteners of her coverall. Her hands stilled. <i class="calibre4">No, I’m not</i>. Evan had been
right. After almost twenty years, her Family boy still knew her very well. She
pondered that disquieting thought as she headed for the bedroom to mine
something presentable from the depths of Risa’s luggage.
</p>


<p class="separator">
<img src="conduct_scene_sep4-transpbg-2fh.gif" alt="Scene Separator" title="Scene Separator" class="calibre5"/>
</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
In contrast to the interior of Jani’s cabin, the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i>
hallways were simple: undecorated walls of light grey composite, floors of dark
grey, footstep-muffling lyno.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani hurried after her guide, a frazzled mainline Spacer
First Class who had apparently been instructed to <i class="calibre4">bring Ms. Tyi to dinner
without delay</i>. Her hip twinged with every step. The outfit she wore, a
tight, one-shoulder, floor-length column dress in dark blue, had not been her
first choice. Or her second. Or her eighth.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Seven damned bags of clothes, and none of them fit</i>!
Jani tugged at the dress again as she struggled to keep up with the sensibly
booted SFC. Her own sensible boots were hiding beneath her bed—cowards that
they were. Her current footwear—strappy, metallic-colored, and high-heeled—had
been spared a one-way trip down the disposal chute solely because they were the
only shoes in her possession that kept the dress from dragging on the floor.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She and Evan were going to have to discuss hazard pay.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The rough polycotton strap of Jani’s duffel bit into the
skin of her bare shoulder. Her choice of handbag might cause raised eyebrows
among her dinner companions, but she didn’t care. Some things, a woman kept
with her at all times. <i class="calibre4">Like her shooter, for example</i>. She straightened
as best she could in her impossible shoes. It had been a very long time since she’d
had to look this polished.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Here we are, ma’am.” The SFC slid to a halt before a
double-wide set of sliders embossed with the Interior seal and knocked sharply.
The doors opened immediately. She mumbled, “Good evening, sir,” and bolted
around the nearest corner just as Evan, resplendent in formal black, stepped
out into the hall.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, this <i class="calibre4">is</i> a change for the better!” His face lit
up as he held out his arm. “I picked that dress,” he added as he led her
inside. “I must say, I have excellent taste.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani tugged at the gown’s rear. “It’s too tight.” The back
of her neck tingled as Evan lagged behind to take in the view.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No, not a bit,” he said. “Just confirms you still have a
waist. Judging from your previous attire, I’d given it up for lost.” As they walked
through the sitting room, Jani heard Evan clear his throat. “Can’t say I agree
with that purse, though.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Bugger,” she said as she strode on ahead. The dark green
and silver suite was furnished with a tasteful, expensive blend of ornate
modern and stark antique. She swallowed a comment that it was larger than some
homes in which she’d lived as the odors coming from the dining room made her
mouth water. Her step quickened. <i class="calibre4">God, I’m starved</i>! Over the past few
months, it seemed she could never get enough to eat.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She pulled up short as she entered the dining room. Evan’s
steadying hand gripped her numb left arm as two pairs of eyes stared in
surprise. Jani managed a composed smile. She recognized her dinner companions
from the postings in various Guv Halls. <i class="calibre4">Maybe this dress wasn’t such a bad
idea after all</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan pushed past her. “Risa, I’d like to introduce two of
the more important members of my staff.” He nodded toward a tall, dark blond
man dressed in a dandyish, pale lilac dinner suit. “This is Durian Ridgeway, my
Documents chief.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani forced herself to extend her hand as Ridgeway pursed
his lips and looked her slowly up and down. “Ms. Tyi.” The soft cast of his
boyish features was offset by the glitter of his blue eyes. “I’ve looked
forward to meeting you.” His accent was clipped and difficult to place.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Earth British</i>, Jani decided. She’d thought New Manx,
at first, but no self-respecting Manxman would have allowed himself to be seen
wearing the curious wad of bright purple braiding Ridgeway had fashioned into a
neckpiece. <i class="calibre4">Clotted octopus</i>, she thought. Maybe it indicated a sense of

Ridgeway beckoned to a slight young woman who appeared lost
amid the furniture. “This is my deputy, Angevin Wyle.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin stepped forward. Her outfit, a fitted copper gauze
gown with matching nosebleed heels, seemed to be giving her trouble as well.
Jani studied her face. Wide-spaced mossy green eyes, carrot red curls shot
through with gold, stubborn chin, all combined to uncover long-buried memories.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I attended school with your father. Hansen Wyle and I
were going to change worlds, once</i>. She accepted Angevin’s subdued greeting.
<i class="calibre4">Then it all fell apart</i>.

Evan herded them toward the dinner table, where a first
course of glistening vegetable jellies coddled in crushed ice awaited. “I’m
glad we could meet now,” he said as he helped Jani with her chair. “I don’t
think we could afford to delay until we returned to Earth.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Perhaps not, Ev,” Ridgeway agreed grudgingly as he assisted
Angevin with her chair. “I’m just hesitant to leave documents of this nature
aboard an unsecured vessel.” He nodded toward the sideboard, where an anodized
metal documents case rested.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani noted the large case’s double touchlocks and felt a
pleasant shiver of anticipation. She hadn’t had the opportunity to handle
close-controlled paper since her Service days.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If you consider the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> unsecured, Durian, we <i class="calibre4">are</i>
in trouble.” Evan speared a tan star-shape with a narrow, two-pronged fork and
ferried the wobbly morsel to his mouth. “But I prefer to believe that in this,
as in so many things, you are erring on the side of caution.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Perhaps.” Ridgeway tried repeatedly to snag a quivering
orange sphere, but the tidbit kept sliding off his fork. “These <i class="calibre4">méduse</i>,”
he said with a nervous chuckle. “I always have trouble eating these things.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s probably afraid of your neckpiece,” Angevin Wyle said
as she executed an expert forking. She chewed thoughtfully, expression placid,
the look in her eyes as flinty as the documents case’s finish.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan coughed and reached for his wineglass. “It is a bit
much, Durian.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Ridgeway fingered his garish neckwear and smiled. Lips only.
The sidelong glare he gave Angevin promised a stern lecture behind closed,
soundproofed doors.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Thy father’s daughter</i>. Jani looked down at her plate to
hide her grin. The <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> suddenly felt very homey.
