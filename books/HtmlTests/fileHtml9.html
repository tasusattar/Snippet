<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_19">Chapter 6</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani sat in the living room of her suite, which occupied a
substantial portion of the second floor rear, Interior House Private, and
listened to the blizzard’s relentless assault against her windows.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
After requesting assistance from the occupants of an office
down the hall from Evan’s, she had soon found herself being passed like a human
baton from one black-clad staffer to another. Interior House Main, the Ministry
headquarters, was a twelve-story-high, two-kilometer-long city-in-miniature,
and Jani felt sure she had been ferried through every centimeter of hallway,
lift shaft, and underground skimway before being deposited within the confines
of her latest home.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I could stop here for a while</i>. Lots of green, icy on
the walls, dark and patterned for rugs and curtains. Flooring and furniture in
blond truewood; lamps and accent pieces in black, burnished copper, and
emerald. The artwork, realistic seascapes and white curves of Channel School
sculpture, were either originals or damned good reproductions.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Makes a difference when you enter through the front door,
doesn’t it</i>? Figuratively speaking. Judging from the sounds filtering
through the sealed windows, Jani didn’t expect to see a Chicago front door for
at least four months.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">If I’m here that long</i>. She sagged further into her
chair. The prospect of getting up seemed as daunting as that of leaving
Chicago, post-augie jitters having given way to travel lag. She closed her eyes
and tried to nap, but nosiness began sending “let’s explore” jolts through her
system. She answered the call and started opening doors and checking drawers.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her bags had already been unpacked, the contents distributed
among chests, armoires, and a walk-in closet the size of the NorthPort tracking
station. A door she thought led to the bathroom actually opened to a fully
applianced kitchenette. Jani checked the cooler and found it stocked with the
fruit drinks and snack foods she vaguely recalled mentioning to one of the
staffers as her favorites. She cracked the seal on a dispo of helgeth and took
a tentative sip. The frothy purple juice tasted crisp and slightly astringent.
She polished off that container and half of another before resuming her search.
She hadn’t realized how thirsty she was.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Another door, palm lock in place but not yet activated, led
into a small office. The room contained a desk, also lockable, on which sat a
workstation with a secured Cabinet link, the newest model parchment imprinter,
and a vase of fresh flowers. Jani stashed the documents case in the desk,
tested the chair, then drew aside the curtain and looked out at the
storm-whipped lake. <i class="calibre4">An office with windows—you’ve skipped up a few grades,
Captain</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She wandered into the bathroom to wash her hands, took one
look at the multijet shower, and soon stood beneath pounding streams of hot
water. Thus refreshed, she rooted through drawers for clean clothes, and
pounced on a set of charcoal grey ship coveralls Lucien had scrounged for her.
She dug out a matching tee shirt emblazoned across the front with the legend
CSS <i class="calibre4">ARAPAHO</i> and freed her scuffed, black, steel-toed boots from the
civilized confines of one of the armoires. Working a towel through her damp
hair, she collected her duffel and returned to her office.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She activated all her locks using a UV stylus she had
liberated from the <i class="calibre4">Arapaho</i> inventory. That task completed, she tried to
return the stylus to its scanproof pocket in her duffel, but something stiff
and sharp-edged slipped into the space and dug into her hand, blocking her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani eased out the holocard, taking special care to avoid
bending it. As she tilted the card back and forth, the two holographed
sailracers swooped and soared like fighting birds. The brilliant
purple-and-blue sails reflected the light like colored mirrors, while the
racers’ multihued wetsuits shimmered with pearly iridescence.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">So, Risa, what’s your real name? I’ve told you mine—it’s
only fair you tell me yours</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Lucien, I’ll tell you mine when you tell me who you’re
working for</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani turned the card over and studied the blank writing
surface. Lucien hadn’t signed his farewell to her, but then, one could hardly
have expected him to leave a traceable signature. For her part, Jani had
bug-scanned the card immediately. Twice. A show of respect. From one
professional to another.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She propped the card against the vase, tilting it until the
two racers were displayed to their best advantage. Then she shouldered her bag,
locked her office, and set out to explore.
</p>


<p class="separator">
<img src="conduct_scene_sep4-transpbg-2fh.gif" alt="Scene Separator" title="Scene Separator" class="calibre5"/>
</p>


<p class="NormalFirst">
Jani paused in a sunroomlike walkway which, according to
the large display in the center of the tiled floor, joined the Colonial Affairs
Offices with Employee Services Section Two, the area she had just left. She
stared at the network of connected mazes glowing in yellow and green on the
display screen, groaning when she realized she was looking at the ground-floor
map only. She touched a pad on the side of the display frame. The mazes
shimmered and altered to form the second floor.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She touched the pad ten more times.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I’m not lost—I’m buried</i>. Outside, snow sheeted
against glass walls and tornadoed into curves and crevices, reinforcing the
illusion. Jani again flipped through floor plans, this time with a better idea
of what she wanted.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Five hours later, she emerged from the Library the proud
possessor of the passcard and linkcodes necessary to access confidential
Cabinet references from her office workstation. She had also arranged for the
delivery of several Earth-based and colonial newssheets, and impressed the head
documents librarian sufficiently to ensure preferential treatment whenever she
submitted a special request.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She’d also stolen a magazine.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I’ll give it back</i>. Jani’s duffel banged against her
hip accusingly, its sides bulging with the addition of an expensive,
paper-bound gossip holozine, the slick cover of which bore the brutally
unretouched image of a glassy-eyed, disheveled Lyssa van Reuter. <i class="calibre4">I’m
surprised Evan allowed this on-site</i>. But librarians were a notoriously
independent-minded lot, and the public’s morbid curiosity regarding the hard
life and violent death of one of the more hologenic Family members apparently
extended to those who should have known better.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The holozine’s title had struck her as particularly
ludicrous. “Lyssa—A Life Tragically Cut Short.” As if a life could be
cheerfully cut short. Maybe they’d explain that novel concept in next month’s
issue. Jani hugged her duffel close as she boarded the first elevator she came
to. She felt a common thief, but she didn’t want Evan to know what she read.
She’d bet her ’pack he’d asked the Library to inform him of what she checked
out. Even independent minds had to follow direct orders from Cabinet Ministers.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The elevator started down. Jani checked her timepiece and
wondered at the possibility of hitching a ride into the city. Just to look
around, get her bearings. It could prove interesting, now the blizzard had
finally stopped.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But first, she needed food. She pressed the second-floor pad
again. There was a cafeteria on that floor, as well as an Interior-subsidized
grocery store. Her stomach rumbled in anticipation of a very late lunch.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her absent gaze fell on the car’s indicator. It had
flickered when she touched it, but the display above the door showed she had
bypassed the second floor and was continuing down. Jani punched floor pads,
then tried to activate the override, but her efforts to halt the car’s descent
failed. She tried to push through the ceiling access panel. No go.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The indicator continued to flash. ONE. GROUND. BASE-ONE.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She was heading for the sub-basements. According to the
touchpad display, Interior Main stretched five floors below ground level.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
BASE-TWO.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Sub-basements were extremely well-secured. They were
designed, after all, to serve as disaster shelters.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
BASE-THREE.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You should have taken the stairs, idiot.” She dug for her
shooter, then tried to crack the seals on the car’s ceiling lights with the
grip. The thick safety plastic resisted—only two of the four lights succumbed.
The car didn’t plunge into darkness—more a cloudy dusk. It would serve.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
BASE-FOUR.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani disengaged her weapon’s safety, then braced against the
car’s rear wall. Feet shoulder width apart. Both hands on the grip. Maybe they
wouldn’t expect her to stand out in the open. Maybe they wouldn’t expect her to
shoot.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Direct line of fire—aim for the chest.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
BASE-FIVE.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The door swept open. Durian Ridgeway, windblown and
agitated, squinted into the car. “Who the—<i class="calibre4">oh</i>. Good afternoon, Ms. Tyi.
This <i class="calibre4">is</i> a restricted-use lift, in case no one informed you.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Sorry,” Jani replied as she secreted her shooter in her
coverall pocket
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He glared at the car ceiling. “What in bloody hell happened
to the lights?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin Wyle bustled in behind him, weighed down with
shopping bags. “Hello, Risa.” She joined Jani in the rear of the car. “Why’s it
so frickin’ dark in here?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Angevin.” Ridgeway thumped the touchpad in the vicinity of
the fourth floor. “Language.” He didn’t bother to ask Jani which floor she
wanted. The door closed like a judgment, and they ascended in silence.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The door opened to reveal a mob. Jani found herself
surrounded by aggressively helpful staffers who first sought to separate her
from her duffel and, when that failed, tried to usher her down the hall toward
a large conference room. At the sight of the reporters, holocam operators, and
Security guards milling at the room’s entrance, she executed a sloppy but
successful <i class="calibre4">excuse me</i> ricochet spin-off. The move propelled her away from
the conference room and past Angevin, who was engaged in heated conversation
with a sulky young man who appeared determined to confiscate her shopping bags.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani skirted around a corner and down an empty hall as
images from the display map paged past her mind’s eye. She wandered up and down
halls, avoiding guards, searching for a stairwell or secondary elevator that
wasn’t alarmed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Close-controlled floors have one and only one
nonemergency entry—slash—exit which means if I want to get out of here without
lighting up the whole damn complex, I have to walk by the cams and have my face
transmitted to every damn colony—shit</i>!
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Ms. Tyi!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani turned to find Durian Ridgeway rushing toward her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Have you seen Angevin? She’s disappeared!” His ruddy face
flushed as he palmed into several of the offices, searching for his wayward
aide. “The meeting begins in five minutes, and she has all my notes. The Deputy
Prime Minister is here. Angevin needs this exposure, damn it, but every time
she gets a chance to put herself forward, she’s nowhere to be found!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">What Angevin needs more than anything are six months’ pay
and an hour’s head start</i>. Jani leaned against the wall and watched Ridgeway
pace. “Sounds important.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He nodded. “Emergency session. Called by Langley.” His mouth
twisted around the Deputy’s name. “‘We’ll meet as soon as you get back,’ he
said. ‘Nothing important,’ he said. Then we pull into the main parking garage
to find vans from every major news service parked there. We had to flee down to
the subs to avoid being blitzed. <i class="calibre4">Bastard</i>.” His voice took on a desperate
edge. “If you could help me find Angevin, Ms. Tyi, I would be very grateful.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani gave him a halfhearted salute, hurrying away before he
felt compelled to say, “please.” She picked a hall where most of the doors
lacked palm locks. She tapped lightly on a couple, then pushed open one
labeled, FURNITURE. The room lights had already been activated, brought to
life, no doubt, by the furious motion taking place atop one of the desks.
Angevin, her long skirt bunched up over her hips, had her bare legs wrapped
around the arching back of the young man with whom Jani had seen her arguing a
few minutes before. He wasn’t sulking now.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani kicked at a nearby trashzap, sending the metal bucket
clattering across the floor. “Durian!” she hissed before forcing the door
closed. She took off down the hall, rounded the corner, and barreled into an
agitated Ridgeway.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What was that noise, Risa?” he asked as he tried to dart
around her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Just me being clumsy,” Jani said as she gripped his arm and
spun him around. “Angevin’s down on the third floor. The parts bins.” That
seemed reasonable. Documents examiners always fretted over their scanpack
functions, especially before important meetings and transactions. “She’ll be on
her way back up within a few minutes. I ran into someone who saw her go down.
There.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I hope she doesn’t show up stinking of broth. Who told you
she was there?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“One of the Security guards.” <i class="calibre4">Please don’t ask which one</i>.
“Angevin gave him a message to give to you. I intercepted.” Jani heaved an
inward sigh as she felt Ridgeway’s arm relax.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, nice to know she hasn’t lost all sense of
responsibility.” He eased out of Jani’s grasp and smoothed the sleeve of his
jacket. “Back to work, then. Thank you, Ms. Tyi.” With a curt nod, he walked
off in the direction of the conference room bustle.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani waited until she felt sure he wouldn’t return. Then she
hurried back around the corner and tapped on the storage-room door. “He’s
gone.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The door cracked open. The young man slipped out first. He
glowered at Jani, looked past her down the hall, then whispered over his
shoulder, “’S ok.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin crept out, jacket in hand. “Please don’t tell
Durian,” she rasped as she struggled into the snug-fitting topper. “He’ll kill
us if he finds—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Don’t <i class="calibre4">fookin</i>’ beg!” The young man’s Channel World
accent could have blunted complexed steel. “We airn’t done nothin’ wrong!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You both shut up.” Jani leaned close to Angevin. Her
frazzled appearance could be written off as travel lag, but no one could
mistake the smashed berry stains surrounding her swollen lips. “Collect your
gear, splash some cold water on your face, and get your ass to that meeting.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Angevin rushed back into the storage room, reemerging with
her documents bag in hand. “Please don’t tell—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani waved her quiet. “You told a <i class="calibre4">male</i> Security guard
to tell Ridgeway you had gone to the parts bins. I ran into the guard and told
him I’d deliver the message. Got that?” Angevin nodded wide-eyed as Jani pushed
her down the hall. She watched her disappear around the corner, then sagged
against the wall. Her neck seized up as she tried to flex it.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We airn’t done nothin’ wrong.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani turned slowly to find the young man still scowling.
He’d pulled a flat copper case from the inside pocket of his tunic and removed
a nicstick. “Airn’t seen each other for over three bloody months.” He stuck the
gold-and-white candy-striped cylinder in his mouth without cracking the
ignition tip, shoved his hands in his trouser pockets, and started pacing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Upon close examination, he proved good-looking, in a pouty,
dissolute choirboy sort of way. Thick, straight auburn hair covered his ears
and collar and flopped over his forehead. His skin had an office pallor, his
uniform black boots needed polishing, and he slouched. <i class="calibre4">Boy, I bet Ridgeway
hated you on sight</i>. “You Channel Worlder?” Jani asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He wheeled. “Yeah!” He stepped close, until his nose was
only centimeters from hers and she could smell the spiced odor of his unignited
nicstick. “So the fook what?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked into his eyes, the same mossy green as
Angevin’s. More bloodshot, though. “What’s your name?” she countered softly.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The question, or the manner in which it was asked, seemed to
throw the young man. His jaw worked. “Steve. Forell.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jersey? Guernsey? Man?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Guernsey.” He took a deep breath. “Helier.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani smiled. “I’ve been to Helier. A beautiful city.” <i class="calibre4">If
you were born with antifreeze in your veins</i>. “And what do you do here at
Interior, Mr. Forell?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The smile began in the depths of the narrowed eyes and
quickly worked down. Steve Forell shook his shaggy head to help it along.
Relaxed and grinning, he looked all of twelve years old. A gamy, street-wise
twelve, but twelve all the same.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Screw that—you’re trying to redirect me attentions.” He
worked his nicstick like a toothpick. “I’m a dexxie, like Ange. Xenopolitical
branch. Work with the idomeni. Schooled at Oxbridge Combined.” He tugged at his
hair. “The xenos came looking for redheads and scooped me up.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Colony boy at an Earthbound school. You must be good.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I am.” The grin flickered as Steve glanced down the hall in
the direction Angevin had gone. “Not good enough, though, according to some.”
Then his smile vanished and instead of looking street-wise and twelve, he
looked lonely, scared, and five and a half.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">See what happens when you learn names. You get involved</i>.
Jani leaned harder into the wall. <i class="calibre4">I do not have the time</i>. Her back ached
now, and the elevator episode coming so soon after the traffic adventure hadn’t
done her post-augie nerves any favors.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What’s the matter with you?” Steve asked. “You look fit to
pass out.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani massaged her tightened scalp. “Can you get me out of
here?” She forced a smile, and felt her travel-dry skin crinkle under the
stress. “I’m not cleared for the close-controlled floors. The elevator won’t
listen to me.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Surprised Durian didn’t have you tossed out a window.”
Steve pushed his way back into the storage room, emerging with Angevin’s
shopping bags. “Here.” He shoved two of the slick plastic sacks into Jani’s
arms and gripped the remaining bags with looped thumbs and forefingers only.
“He even picks out her clothes,” he grumbled as he glanced at the bags’
contents. “We’ll leave them with the door guard. Meeting’ll go on for hours,
anyway.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
They walked back to the elevators. The area had been cleared
of cams and reporters; a pair of guards stood sentry by the closed
conference-room doors. They eyed Jani warily, but relaxed when Steve walked
over and handed them the bags.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“What now?” he asked as he rejoined her. He flipped open a
panel beside the elevator and punched in a code sequence.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I haven’t eaten since the Luna shuttle. That was over ten
hours ago. Just point me toward the food.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You need dinner?” Steve brightened. “I could do with some
dinner. The cafeteria on Two is the best one. That’s where all the nobbies
eat.” The doors closed, and he blinked in surprise. “What the hell happened to
the lights?”
</p>
