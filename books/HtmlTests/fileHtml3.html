<h2 class="ToC" id="calibre_toc_14">Chapter 2</h2>


<p class="NormalFirst">
Scrub and sand blurred past as Jani concentrated on the
approaching tracking station. The squat building sat like an overturned bowl in
the middle of the plain, its safety beacon shining gamely through the fog.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The steadying hand on her shoulder returned as the calmness
reasserted itself. A survival checklist formed in her mind. What she had to do,
how quickly, and how thoroughly. She hadn’t always been that organized. The
Service had literally drilled it into her head. Augmentation. The implants in
her brain that had, at least officially, made her a soldier. Jani resented
augie when she didn’t need it, but gripped it like a life preserver now. As she
neared the station, it kept her focused, compelled her to watch the shallow
recesses in the dome, the dark shadows where someone could hide.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She circled the small dome twice before she edged the
skimmer into its charge slot. Shooter at the ready, she carded through the
station’s two sets of doors and scanned the cell-like single room. Finding
nothing out of place, she set the weapon on standby and tucked it into the belt
of her coverall. Working with speed born of habit and dispassion born of
chemistry, she packed her few clothes into her small duffel. Then she stripped
the bed and bath area, feeding the flimsy sheets and towels into the trashzap.
The volume of material overwhelmed the unit’s filter; the odor of burnt cloth
filled the room.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani rummaged through one of the side compartments of her
duffel and carefully withdrew the small Naxin bomb. After the protein digester
did its work, no trace of her presence, no hair, skin cell, or fingerprint,
would remain. A second bomb nestled in her bag. She would use it on the skimmer
after she reached the shuttleport.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani checked her timepiece. Shuttles to the NorthPort docks
departed every half hour, but with the slowdown, there was no guarantee they’d
follow their normal schedule. She sat on the narrow bed, bomb in hand. If this
all turned out to be nothing, there would be hell to pay. Naxin lingered like
bad memories—the station would require a thorough decontamination. Expensive
decontamination. <i class="calibre4">In other words, kiss this job good-bye</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
But who knew? Maybe the desk clerk’s friend with the
Registry job would come to her aid. Jani smiled sadly. Who could guess the
offer of a Registry job would hold enough attraction to make her drop her
carefully maintained guard?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Someone who knew her well.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">And who knows you that well, Captain Kilian</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She broke the seal on the protein bomb, set it on the
mattress, and hurried toward the door. Within seconds, the device’s outer
housing would split, releasing a steady yellow stream of digestive mist.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Just as the door swept open, the station’s proximity alarm
activated. “Skimmer approaching from north-northwest,” the tinny voice entoned.
“Speed sixty-five kilometers per hour. Single occupant. Estimated time of
arrival two minutes.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani looked back at the bed. The protein bomb emitted a
sound like cracking ice, releasing the first puffs of corrosive fog. Too late
to hurl it out the door. A few good pulls of Naxin would turn her lungs to
soup.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She let the station’s inner door close behind her, backed
against the narrow entryway wall, and forced the outer door to remain closed by
pushing with her left foot against its raised metal frame. Then she reached up
and shattered the casing of the overhead light with the grip of her shooter,
plunging the small space into darkness. In the meantime, the barest whiff of
Naxin had worked its way through the gaps in the inner door seal. Jani closed
her eyes against the stinging mist and stifled a cough.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The alarm spoke again. “Approach is made.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She activated her shooter. After her visitor made a few
attempts to force the door, she’d pull her foot away. Allow the door to open.
Then wait for that first tentative step forward into the dark.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Oblique line of fire—aim for the head.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani heard the crunch of footsteps, a plastic click as
someone inserted a card into the reader, silence as the jammed door forced the
reader to deny access. Again, the click of the card. Once more, nothing.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Damn her!”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">That voice</i>. Jani tensed as the outer door shook under
the force of banging knocks.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani! It’s Evan! Please let me in!” A pause. “I’m alone.”
Softer. “Please.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her calm cracked like the bomb housing. <i class="calibre4">Oh God! Not him!</i>
She tightened her grip on her weapon. <i class="calibre4">They wouldn’t let him come here alone</i>.
Evan. Van Reuter. The Commonwealth Interior Minister. No security officer worth
a damn would have allowed him to wander unescorted on any colony. His face had
been plastered on the cover of every newssheet for weeks—even the most
info-starved transport jockey would recognize him.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani? Jani?” The banging resumed, louder, more insistent.
The air in the tiny space shook with the noise. “<i class="calibre4">I know you’re in there!
Talk to me!</i>”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
More Naxin had seeped into the enclosure, choking Jani’s
breath away as she tried to inhale. Her eyes burned. The skin of her face felt
hot. She pulled her foot away from the door. It slid open, but she remained
back in the shadows, letting the cold air pour over her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
At first, nothing. Then Evan van Reuter stepped forward.
Almost twenty years had passed since Jani had seen that tall, slim form, that
tilt of the head. Not as much of a stomach-clench as with the Haárin. Not
quite. “Should I curtsy, Excellency?” she asked as she stepped out of the doorway,
forcing him to backpedal.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani?” He stared at her, broad brow furrowed in confusion.
“Is that you?” Then his gaze fell on her shooter. Thin lips tensed in a tight
line. Dark, hooded eyes narrowed. Jani could hear his thoughts as though he
spoke them out loud. After so long, he was unsure of her. She almost felt
flattered.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“It’s really me, Evan.” She disengaged the power pack and
shoved her inactivated weapon into her duffel.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan thrust his hands into the pockets of his Interior field
coat. The hem of the heavy black garment flapped around his knees as the wind
howled. “I need to talk to you. It’s important. But it’s freezing out here!
Can’t we go inside?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani shook her head. She felt the augmentation leach away,
leaving vague edginess in its place. She held up her right hand and watched it
shake. “Can’t. Bombed it.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, at least we can get out of this damned wind!” Evan
grabbed her arm and pulled her after him behind the small building. There, a
sleek black sedan hovered shadowlike beside her battered single-seater.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He yanked open the sedan’s gullwing and pushed Jani into the
passenger seat. The heavy door closed over her with a solid <i class="calibre4">thunk</i>. Black
trueleather cushions, soft as butter, sensed her chill and grew warm.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan got in beside her and pulled his door closed. “God, how
can you live here!” He dug under his seat, came up first with a large
thermoflask, then two polished metal cups.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
He thrust one of the cups into Jani’s hand and filled it.
The weighty aromas of chocolate and fresh coffee flooded the cabin. Despite her
nerves, her mouth watered—she hadn’t tasted truebean in years. She drained her
cup with childlike greed.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani? For cry—you want more?” Evan held out the
thermoflask, then hesitated. “What’s wrong with your face? It’s all red.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She felt her cheek. Despite exposure to cold wind and rain,
the skin felt dry and hot. “Naxin exposure. It’s like sunburn. I’ll be fine.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I have to get you to a doctor—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I’ll be <i class="calibre4">fine</i>.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan retreated slowly. “And to think I thought this would be
the easy part, after what I went through to find you.” He set his cup in a
niche in the dash and dug through his coat pockets. “I had nothing to go on.
Your file’s been buried. All I had was your canceled lieutenant’s ID, the one
you gave me after your promotion to captain. I had copies made, sent out to my
people.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Like your blonde from SouthPort Consolidated?” Jani slumped
in her seat and felt the ergoworks vibrate in their efforts to support her
properly. “Why that hostel? Why the hell did I have to run into <i class="calibre4">that</i> hostel?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I had people all over NorthPort,” Evan said as he searched.
“SouthPort, too. The docks. I had no intention of letting you slip away.” He
pulled a tiny slipcase from the inside pocket of his coat. “My blonde came back
and told me they had found a likely suspect. You, of course. Only problem was,
you didn’t look like the holo. But she did say the Haárin liked you, you were
damned good at your job, and the people you worked for couldn’t figure you out.
That sounded familiar.” He removed a card from the slipcase and handed it to
Jani. “The crash changed things, I guess.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani avoided looking at the ID at first, then grim
fascination got the better of her. She took the card from Evan and stared at
the image that smirked back.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Her hair had been longer then. A stick-straight,
collar-grazing pageboy, rather than the scalp-hugging cap of waves she now
bore, framed a rounder, less angular face. Fringed bangs accentuated thicker
eyebrows, an upward-curving nose.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani ran a finger along her current arched bridge. Her
coloring hadn’t changed, though. Hair thick and black, then as now. Skin still
light brown. Eyes . . . still green.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Well, they are—I just don’t show them to company</i>. The
black color filming she’d applied the previous day felt scratchy in the dry air
of the skimmer cabin. She restrained the urge to rub her eyes and refocused on
her image. Yellow lieutenant’s bars imprinted with tiny silver <i class="calibre4">D</i>s shone
from the sides of her steel blue banded collar. Sideline yellow. Sideline
Service. Not the real thing, her mainline buddies had stressed to her
repeatedly. Real lieutenants, <i class="calibre4">mainline</i> lieutenants, had red bars. She
was a documents examiner. Ineligible for command school. Banned from combat
training. Not a real soldier.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">Let us sing a song of real soldiers</i>. Jani tossed the
ID back in Evan’s lap. “Too little-girly, don’t you think?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan grabbed the card before it slid to the floor, polishing
the places where his fingers had smudged the surface. “I always liked it,” he
muttered defensively as he tucked it gently back into the slipcase and returned
it to his pocket.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
A few fidgety moments passed. Jani toyed with her empty cup.
“I didn’t see you on the welcoming committee.” She shrugged at Evan’s puzzled
frown. “That thing for Tsecha. They broadcast the holoVee show here today, but
it happened over six weeks ago. Takes about that long to get here from Earth.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Jani—”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Even sooner, when you can clear the nav paths by invoking
ministerial privilege. What are you doing here?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan tapped a thumb against the skimmer’s steering wheel.
He’d worked off his coat, revealing the dress-down Interior uniform of
loose-fitting black tunic tucked into dark grey trousers. His profile, backlit
by the skimmer cabin’s subdued lighting, now resembled his late father’s in a
way Jani would never have thought possible years before. <i class="calibre4">From Acton to
Evan—the van Reuter hawk lives</i>. Closely clipped dark brown hair accentuated
his cheekbone, the curve of his long jaw, the line of his neck. <i class="calibre4">What I used
to do to that neck</i>.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Correction, what the girl in the ID used to do to that neck.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan sipped his coffee. “The reason I didn’t attend the
welcoming ceremony for the ambassador,” he said quietly, “is because the PM
requested I stay away.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That makes no sense. You knew Tsecha when we were stationed
in Rauta Shèràa. You’re the only minister who can claim that. Doesn’t Cao
realize how valuable that experience is?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan smiled grimly. “Thanks for the vote of confidence. I’ll
add you to my list of supporters. There’s plenty of room—it’s shrinking as we
speak.” He watched the storm rage outside. “How much have you heard out here
about my wife’s death?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“We heard what we were told,” Jani said. Every aspect picked
over in sickening detail. Tsecha’s welcoming was the first program she had
watched in the four months since. “Lyssa died at the spa on Chira.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“An accident?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“With mitigating circumstances. Hints she’d been ill.” Jani
hesitated. “Later, there were rumors she’d been drinking, doping. She tried to
hop the road skimmer she was driving over a narrow gorge. Road skimmers don’t
hop. She lost control, flipped into a rock formation.” She remembered the
OC-Net cut-in, the crumpled skimmer, and the reporter running his hands over
the rocks in question with the bright-eyed wonder of someone who had never seen
a person die.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Any—” Evan’s voice cracked. He pulled the thermoflask from
beneath the seat and refilled both their cups. “Any speculation that I could
have been involved?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani studied the side of Evan’s face. Only the way his jaw
muscle worked indicated the tension he otherwise managed to hide. “No. Why
would there be?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“There have been rumors, damning enough for the Cabinet to
initiate a Court of Inquiry. That’s why Cao asked me to stay away. Because
things are so touchy. Our relations with the idomeni. Earth’s relations with
the colonies. Our colonies butting heads with the idomeni colonies. Does the
term ‘vicious circle’ mean anything to you?” Evan’s hand moved to his throat.
“Cao’s trying to use it like a noose around my neck. She and her old school
friend, Exterior Minister Ulanova. I don’t agree with the way they do business.
They want me gone.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You once told me the occasional purge is a fact of
political life.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t possess the edge I used to, Jan. My wife is dead.
Our children died years ago. I stink of death. It drives people away. People I
thought I could count on.” The rain had intensified, sluicing down the windows
as though they sat beneath a waterfall. “The knives are out for me this time. I
can’t fight alone.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Jani watched the rain. The statement that Evan was only
forty-two, that he’d live to fight another day, remarry and father his own
Cabinet if he so desired, didn’t seem appropriate. Death altered that scenario.
It raised imposing questions. Questions of coping, closure, setting the record
straight. <i class="calibre4">And I know all about that, don’t I</i>?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
She heard Evan stir beside her.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I believe Lyssa was murdered, too, you see,” he said. “I
think since we’re on speaking terms with the idomeni again, someone wants me
out of the picture. That’s why I need a friend.” He reached out to her, his
hand hovering above hers without touching. “A friend who can find out what
happened.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You want to take me back to Earth with you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I need your help, Jan. I need a friend who knows me, knows
the idomeni, and knows where the bones are buried.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">I buried some of those bones</i>, Jani thought as she
watched Evan’s hand. It shook. Very slightly. Did she make him that nervous? Or
was he in that much trouble?
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I know what we had didn’t end well,” he said as he let his
hand rest on the seat near her knee. “Do you hold a grudge?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I didn’t think so. You’re not the type. You follow your own
rules, your own code. You’re tough, but you’re fair.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You haven’t known me for a long time. I may have changed.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan continued as though she hadn’t spoken. “For my part,
I’d show how much I trust you by placing my career in your hands. All I ask is
that, as events warrant, you proceed with caution.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“That would be a first for me, don’t you think?” Jani
studied her distorted reflection in her cup’s polished surface. “You really
want to take me back to Earth?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You have to go somewhere. My blonde mentioned I blew your
situation here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“‘Blew’ doesn’t begin to describe it. The Merchants’
Association blames me for your traffic slowdown. They think <i class="calibre4">I’m</i> a verifier.
I’m probably being watched. If I returned to NorthPort after being seen with
you, I’d be dead by nightfall.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“So, you need to get out of here.” Evan’s voice sounded
stronger, surer. That made sense. He was negotiating now. “Ok, I’ll get you out
of here. Where do you want to go?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Then what’s wrong with Earth?” He counted on his fingers.
“Look, we pass through four GateWays on the way. Amsun, Padishah, Felix, and
Mars. If you change your mind on the way, I’ll give you whatever you need and
let you go.” He leaned toward her, his voice coldly eager.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“But if you had a chance to work at a job that utilized your
training, realized you could live a different life, wouldn’t it make sense to
stick with me? Look around you, Jan.” He gestured toward the storm-whipped
scenery. “You don’t belong here. You deserve a second chance. Officially, sure,
the Service is still looking for you, but unofficially?” He shook his head.
“They think you’re dead. You can reinvent yourself any way you want, and I’m
offering you the opportunity to do just that.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If I work for you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“If you find out what happened to Lyssa. Call it working for
me if you want. Call it anything.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“You could be the bait in a Service trap. Why should I trust
you?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Well, if what you told me about your popularity in
NorthPort is true, you’d better trust me at least as far as Amsun.” He raised
his cup to her in a toast. “What choice do you have?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
<i class="calibre4">What choice, indeed</i>? Jani stared into her cup. Then
she drained it and handed it back to him. “You know, some old Service officer
once said that if you fall back far enough, you’ll just wind up at the front
again.” She pulled the second Naxin bomb from her duffel and punched a
fingernail through the sealant coating. Popping up her door, she darted into
the rain, pulled open the door of the single-seater, tossed the bomb inside,
slammed the door, and closed herself back in the sedan before the first wisps
of Naxin appeared in her old skimmer’s windows.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan stared at her. “That was quick.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“The Service taught me things like that, remember?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Remind me never to pull up next to you.” He glanced down at
the floor near her feet. His smile flickered back to life. “Still carrying your
bag of tricks, I see.” He punched the sedan’s charge-through. The vehicle activated
with a low hum. “I’ll send some people over to mop up. It’ll be like you were
never even here.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“They’re going to need HazMat gear.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“People always need HazMat gear when they clean up after
you. It’s one of the constants of life.” His eyes glistened with suppressed
merriment. He reversed the skimmer out of its slot, then eased it forward. “Is
there anyone you want to message before we leave? Anyone you need to notify?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“No,” Jani said. That was the advantage with avoiding
names—it always made bugging out easier. She reached beneath Evan’s seat for
the thermoflask. “I didn’t watch the entire welcome program. Were you the only
minister Cao took exception to?”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan steered the skimmer into a wide, banking turn. “No,
there were more. Gisela Detmers-Neumann, the Communications Minister. Fitzhugh
and Ebben, the deputies from Commerce. Unser from Education.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Coffee sloshed into Jani’s lap, running down her weatherall
and spilling to the skimmer floor. “Why them?” she asked.
</p>
<p class="Normal">
Evan looked at her, then at the beading puddle on the
carpet. “Now, Jani, you of all people should know the answer to that.” He
reached into the glove box, pulled out a dispo, and handed it to her. “Don’t
get too nervous. This visit doesn’t have to be all business. Who knows, you
might run into Tsecha. You were his pet at the Academy. I’m sure he’d enjoy
seeing you again.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“At this point,” Jani said as she dabbed at the spilled
coffee, “I think any running I’d do with regard to him would be in the opposite
direction.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
The faint glow of the shuttle pad glimmered in the distance.
Evan pressed the accelerator. “By the way,” he asked, “who was that old Service
officer? You always used to mention him in Rauta Shèràa, too.”
</p>
<p class="Normal">
“Wasn’t a ‘him.’ Was a ‘her.’” Jani sighed. “It was me.”
</p>
